Hi [Name],

I came across your profile while researching advisors who specialize in federal employee retirement planning.

I run FedBuyOut.com, a calculator that helps federal employees evaluate buyout offers vs pension benefits. We receive pre-qualified leads from users actively considering buyouts and retirement decisions.

**Our leads include:**
- Current salary and years of service
- FERS/CSRS system type
- Buyout vs pension calculation
- Contact info (email, phone)
- Timeline for decision

**Sample lead data attached.**

Would you be interested in purchasing pre-qualified leads? We typically charge $50-150 per lead depending on quality and completeness.

Happy to send a few sample leads to demonstrate quality.

Best regards,
Clark Mafora
