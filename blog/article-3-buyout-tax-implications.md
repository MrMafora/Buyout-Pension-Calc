If you're offered a $25,000 federal buyout, how much do you actually keep? Most federal employees are shocked to learn it's not $25,000 - it's closer to **$16,000 after taxes**.

Understanding the tax implications is critical to making an informed decision about your buyout offer. This guide breaks down exactly what you'll pay in federal, state, Social Security, and Medicare taxes.

## How Federal Buyouts Are Taxed

Federal buyouts (VSIP payments) are treated as **supplemental wages** by the IRS. This means they're subject to different withholding rules than regular paychecks.

### Federal Income Tax Withholding

For supplemental wages over $1 million (not applicable to buyouts), the withholding is straightforward. For typical federal buyouts up to $25,000:

**Federal Withholding: 22%**

On a $25,000 buyout:
```
$25,000 × 22% = $5,500 withheld
```

**Important:** This is just withholding. Your actual tax rate may be higher or lower depending on your total income for the year.

### Social Security and Medicare Taxes (FICA)

Buyouts are also subject to FICA taxes:

**Social Security: 6.2%**
**Medicare: 1.45%**
**Total FICA: 7.65%**

On a $25,000 buyout:
```
$25,000 × 7.65% = $1,912.50
```

**Note:** If you're already over the Social Security wage base ($168,600 for 2026), you'll only pay Medicare taxes (1.45%) on the buyout.

## State Income Tax Impact

State taxes on buyouts vary dramatically depending on where you live:

### States with NO Income Tax (0%)

- North Carolina: 4.5%
- Pennsylvania: 3.07%

**On $25,000: $500-$1,125**

### Medium Tax States (5-7%)
- California: 5-6%
- Georgia: 5.49%
- Illinois: 4.95%
- Massachusetts: 5%
- Michigan: 4.25%
- Ohio: 2.75-3.99%

- California: up to 12.3%
- Hawaii: up to 11%
- New Jersey: up to 10.75%
- New York: up to 10.9%
- Oregon: up to 9.9%

Federal withholding 22%:   -$5,500
FICA taxes 7.65%:          -$1,913
State tax 0%:              $0
                           -------
Net after taxes:           $17,587
```

**You keep: 70.3%**

### Example 2: Virginia (Medium Tax)
```
Buyout:                    $25,000

State tax 9.3%:            -$2,325

```

**You keep: 61.0%**

## Federal Tax Bracket Considerations

The 22% withholding is just a starting point. Your actual tax liability depends on your total income:

### 2026 Federal Tax Brackets (Single Filers)
- 10%: $0 - $11,925
- 12%: $11,926 - $48,475
- 22%: $48,476 - $103,350
- 24%: $103,351 - $197,300
- 32%: $197,301 - $250,525

### Example Scenario

**Your situation:**
- Regular salary: $70,000
- Buyout: $25,000
- **Total income: $95,000**

**Tax implications:**
- Without buyout: Top of 12% bracket
- With buyout: Pushes you into 22% bracket
- Some of your buyout taxed at 22% (not 12%)

**Possible outcome:** You may owe additional taxes when you file your return if the 22% withholding wasn't enough.

## Strategies to Minimize Buyout Taxes

### 1. Time Your Buyout

If possible, negotiate the payment timing:

**Take in January:**
- Spreads tax impact across the year
- Gives you 12+ months before tax payment due
- Can adjust withholding for remainder of year

**Take in December:**
- Tax impact hits immediately
- Less time to plan and adjust
- May result in underpayment penalties

### 2. Increase Tax Deductions

Reduce your taxable income through:
- Maximize TSP contributions ($23,000 + $7,500 catch-up if 50+)
- Traditional IRA contributions ($7,000 + $1,000 catch-up)
- HSA contributions ($4,150 individual / $8,300 family)
- Charitable donations
- Medical expenses (if >7.5% of AGI)

### 3. Adjust W-4 Withholding

If taking a buyout mid-year:
- Submit new W-4 to increase withholding
- Cover the additional tax liability
- Avoid underpayment penalties

### 4. Quarterly Estimated Payments

If you owe additional taxes:
- Make quarterly estimated payments
- Due dates: April, June, September, January
- Avoid penalties and interest

### 5. Consider State Tax Implications

If you're planning to move:
- Moving to a no-tax state before taking buyout could save thousands
- Establish residency before receiving payment
- Consult a tax professional

## Common Tax Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Thinking You Keep the Full Amount

Many employees budget based on $25,000 but only receive $16,000-$17,500. This creates cash flow problems.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring the Tax Bracket Bump

The buyout may push you into a higher tax bracket, meaning more of your income (not just the buyout) gets taxed at higher rates.

### Mistake 3: Not Adjusting Withholding

If you don't adjust your W-4 after taking a buyout, you may owe significant taxes at year-end plus penalties.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting State Taxes

Federal employees often focus on federal taxes but forget state tax implications, which can be substantial.

### Mistake 5: Not Planning for Next Year

The buyout affects this year's taxes, but also impacts next year's tax planning, especially if you have different income sources.

## Special Situations

### Age 50+ Catch-Up Contributions

If you're 50 or older, maximize catch-up contributions:
- TSP: Extra $7,500 (total $30,500)
- IRA: Extra $1,000 (total $8,000)

This reduces your taxable income significantly.

### Early Retirement and TSP

If you take a buyout and access TSP before age 59½:
- **10% early withdrawal penalty** on taxable portion
- Exceptions apply (SEPP, disability, etc.)
- Consider rolling to IRA for more flexibility

### Military Retirement + Federal Buyout

If you have military retirement:
- Military pension continues (not affected by buyout)
- Buyout is separate taxable event
- FERS pension calculations unaffected
