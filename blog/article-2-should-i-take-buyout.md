If you're a federal employee facing a buyout offer in 2026, you're probably wondering: *Should I take it?* This decision can impact your finances for decades, so it's worth understanding the full picture before you decide.

## What Is a Federal Buyout?

A federal buyout (officially called VSIP - Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment) is a lump-sum payment offered to federal employees to voluntarily leave their positions. In 2026, these payments are typically **up to $25,000** before taxes.

Buyouts are usually offered during:
- Agency reorganizations
- Budget reductions  
- Workforce restructuring
- Early retirement programs (VERA)

## The Core Question: Pension vs Buyout

The fundamental decision comes down to this trade-off:

**Take the Buyout:**
- ✅ Immediate lump sum ($25,000 max)
- ✅ Freedom to pursue other opportunities
- ❌ Lose future pension growth
- ❌ Possible early retirement penalties

**Keep Working:**
- ✅ Higher pension when you retire
- ✅ Continued benefits and job security
- ❌ No immediate payout
- ❌ Must keep working

## Calculating Your Pension Value

To make an informed decision, you need to know what your pension is worth. For FERS employees:

**Pension Formula:**
```
High-3 Salary × Years of Service × Multiplier = Annual Pension
```

**Multipliers:**
- Standard: 1.0% per year
- Age 62+ with 20+ years: 1.1% per year
- Special provisions (LEO, Firefighter, ATC): 1.7% per year

**Example:**
- High-3: $80,000
- Years of service: 20
- Multiplier: 1.0%
- **Annual pension: $16,000** ($1,333/month)

## Break-Even Analysis: The Key Number

The most important calculation is your **break-even point** - how long until your pension catches up to the buyout value.

**Simple Example:**
- Buyout offer: $25,000
- Annual pension increase from working 1 more year: $1,600 (2% of $80,000)
- **Break-even: 15.6 years**

If you live longer than 15.6 years after retirement, keeping working was the better financial decision.

But wait - there's more to consider:

### The Time Value of Money

That $25,000 buyout could be invested. At 6% annual return:
- Year 10: $44,770
- Year 20: $80,178

Now your break-even extends even further.

## Early Retirement Penalties: The Hidden Cost

If you're under your **Minimum Retirement Age (MRA)** - typically 56-57 for FERS - taking a buyout means penalties:

**5% reduction per year under age 62**

**Example:**
- You're age 58 (4 years under 62)
- Full pension: $16,000/year
- Penalty: 20% (4 years × 5%)
- **Reduced pension: $12,800/year**

This penalty applies for life, significantly impacting your break-even calculation.

## Tax Implications: What You Actually Keep

Don't forget - that $25,000 buyout isn't all yours:

### Federal Income Tax
- Buyouts taxed as supplemental wages
- **22% federal withholding** (may be more at tax time)
- On $25,000: **$5,500 to IRS**

### Social Security & Medicare
- **7.65% FICA tax**
- On $25,000: **$1,912.50**

### State Income Tax
- Varies by state (0-13%)
- Average: **5%**
- On $25,000: **$1,250**

### Total Tax Impact
```
$25,000 buyout
- $5,500 federal (22%)
- $1,913 FICA (7.65%)
- $1,250 state (5%)
= $16,337 net
```

**You keep about 65% of the buyout.**

## Other Factors to Consider

### Health Insurance (FEHB)

Taking a buyout may affect your health insurance:
- **Immediate Retirement:** Keep FEHB with same premium
- **Deferred Retirement:** Lose FEHB eligibility
- **Private Insurance:** Often more expensive

### TSP Impact

- Lost employer matching (5%) if you leave
- Lost contributions while you find new work
- Potential early withdrawal penalties if under 59½

### Career Considerations

- Job market for your skills
- Starting salary in private sector
- Career growth potential
- Job security vs entrepreneurship

### Personal Factors

- Stress and job satisfaction
- Health considerations
- Family obligations
- Retirement lifestyle goals

## Decision Framework

### Take the Buyout If:
- ✅ You have strong private sector job prospects
- ✅ You're close to retirement age anyway
- ✅ The stress/satisfaction equation favors leaving
- ✅ You have other income sources
- ✅ You can invest the buyout for higher returns

### Keep Working If:
- ✅ You're far from retirement age
- ✅ Your pension growth is significant
- ✅ You value job security
- ✅ Health insurance is critical
- ✅ You enjoy your work

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Young Employee
- **Age:** 45
- **Service:** 15 years
- **High-3:** $70,000
- **Buyout:** $25,000
- **Result:** Don't take it. Early retirement penalties are severe, and 20 more years of pension growth is worth far more than $25,000.

### Example 2: Near Retirement
- **Age:** 60
- **Service:** 28 years
- **High-3:** $95,000
- **Buyout:** $25,000
- **Result:** Maybe. Only 2 years of penalties, but pension is already substantial. Depends on job market and personal preference.

### Example 3: Ready to Leave
- **Age:** 62
- **Service:** 30 years
- **High-3:** $85,000
- **Buyout:** $25,000
- **Result:** Strong consideration. No penalties, full retirement eligible, buyout is bonus money.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring Taxes
Many employees think they'll keep the full $25,000. After taxes, it's closer to $16,000.

### 2. Forgetting Inflation
Your pension has COLA adjustments. The buyout doesn't.

### 3. Overlooking Benefits
Health insurance, TSP matching, and other benefits have real value.

### 4. Emotional Decisions
Don't take a buyout just because you're frustrated. Run the numbers first.

### 5. Not Getting Advice
Consider consulting a fee-only financial advisor who understands federal benefits.
