## CTA Best Practices

|------|--------|

### CTA Design Principles

1. **Be Specific**: "Get the VSIP Checklist" beats "Download"
2. **Use First Person**: "Schedule My Consultation" converts better
3. **Create Urgency**: "Limited spots available" when true
4. **Reduce Friction**: "Free," "No obligation," "Takes 2 minutes"
5. **One Primary Action**: Don't compete with multiple CTAs
