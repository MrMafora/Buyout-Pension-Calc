Subject: We Miss You at FedBuyOut

Hi {{firstName}},

We noticed you haven't opened our emails in a while, and I wanted to check in.

Life gets busy. Inboxes get full. Priorities change. I totally understand.

But before I assume you're no longer interested, I wanted to ask:

**Are federal pension buyouts still relevant to you?**

If yes, great! Here's what you might have missed:

📊 Updated pension valuation calculator
📈 Latest market trends affecting buyout rates
💼 New case studies from recent clients
📋 Step-by-step guide to the buyout process

If no, that's okay too. I just want to make sure we're not cluttering your inbox with something you've moved on from.

**Two quick options:**

[YES, Keep Me Updated] → I'll make sure you get our best content
[NO, Unsubscribe Me] → No hard feelings, truly

Either way, I appreciate you giving us a chance.

Best regards,

The FedBuyOut Team

P.S. If you're just overwhelmed by email frequency, you can [update your preferences] to receive only monthly updates instead of our full sequence.

### Design Notes
- Keep it short (under 150 words)

Subject: What's Changed in Pension Buyouts (And Why It Matters)

Hi {{firstName}},

A lot has changed in the pension buyout landscape since you first joined our list. I thought you might want to know what's happening—even if you ultimately decide a buyout isn't for you.

**Interest Rate Impact**

Interest rates have shifted significantly. For pension buyouts, this matters because:

• Higher rates = Different buyout valuations
• Timing can affect offers by 10-15%
• The window for optimal rates may be closing

**New Legislation Considerations**

Recent discussions in Congress about federal employee benefits could affect:

• Future COLA calculations
• Buyout taxation structures
• Early retirement options

Nothing's final yet, but we're monitoring closely.

**Client Success Story**

"I waited two years to explore my options. When I finally called FedBuyOut, I learned I'd missed the optimal window by about six months. Don't wait like I did."
— Michael R., TSA employee, 28 years

**The Bottom Line**

Even if you're not ready to act, staying informed helps you make better decisions. Knowledge has value, even if the timing isn't right yet.

Want to know how current conditions affect your specific pension?

Or if you'd rather not receive these updates anymore, I understand:

[Unsubscribe]

## Email 3: Final Chance

**Subject Lines:**

- Removing You Tomorrow Unless...
- {{firstName}}, One Last Question

**Preview Text:** This is our final attempt to provide value...

### Content Structure

```
Subject: Final Notice: Should We Keep You Updated?

Hi {{firstName}},

This is the last email I'll send unless I hear from you.

I've sent you a few emails over the past week trying to reconnect, but I haven't heard back. Rather than continue cluttering your inbox, I'm going to remove you from our list.

But before I do, one last time:

**Are you still interested in learning about pension buyouts?**

If YES → [Click Here to Stay Subscribed]

You'll continue receiving:
• Market updates affecting your pension
• Educational content on your options
• Occasional consultation offers

If NO → Do nothing. You'll be automatically removed in 48 hours.

---

**What You'll Miss:**

If we remove you, you won't hear about:

• Changes in buyout market conditions
• New tools and calculators we develop
• Special consultation availability
• Federal pension policy updates

But if that content isn't valuable to you, then you absolutely shouldn't receive it.

**I Respect Your Inbox**

Email is a privilege, not a right. If we're not providing value, we don't deserve your attention.

That's why I'm making this so easy:

• Want to stay? One click keeps you subscribed
• Want to leave? Do nothing and you're removed automatically

No guilt. No hard feelings. Just respect for your time.

**One Last Thing**

Even if you unsubscribe today, our door is always open. If you ever want to explore your pension options in the future, just visit fedbuyout.com or call 1-800-FED-BUYOUT.

We'd be glad to help whenever you're ready.

Take care,

Clark Thompson
Founder, FedBuyOut

P.S. Still reading but don't want to click? Just reply with "KEEP ME" or "REMOVE ME" and I'll handle it personally.

[YES, Keep Me Subscribed →]
```

### Design Notes
- Clear deadline (48 hours)
- Passive unsubscribe (do nothing = removed)
- Active opt-in required to stay
- Professional, respectful tone
- No desperation or guilt

## Alternative: The Soft Re-engagement

For high-value leads who went cold, consider a gentler approach:

### The "Value Bomb" Single Email

**Subject:** The One Thing I Wish Every Federal Employee Knew

**Content:**
- Single, high-value insight
- No ask
- No CTA except reply
- Personal sign-off

Example:

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I was reviewing some client files this morning and realized there's one insight that would have helped nearly all of them—even those who didn't do a buyout.

**The 5-Year Rule:**

Most federal employees make their pension decision within 5 years of eligibility. But the optimal financial window often closes 2-3 years BEFORE that.

Why? Because buyout valuations are based on:
• Current interest rates (not future ones)
• Your current age (younger = better buyout multiples)
• Market conditions (which change)

Waiting until you're "ready" to retire often means missing the best buyout window.

I'm not saying rush into anything. But I am saying: understand your numbers NOW, even if you don't act for years.

That's it. No pitch, no CTA. Just something I wish someone had told me when I started this business.

If you want to discuss your specific numbers, you know where to find us. If not, no worries.

Either way, I hope this helps.

Best regards,

Clark
