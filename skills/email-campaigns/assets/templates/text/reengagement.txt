We Miss You at FedBuyOut
=========================

Hi {{firstName}},

We noticed you haven't opened our emails in a while, and I wanted to check in.

Life gets busy. Inboxes get full. Priorities change. I totally understand.

But before I assume you're no longer interested, I wanted to ask:

ARE PENSION BUYOUTS STILL RELEVANT TO YOU?

If yes, great! Here's what you might have missed:

- Updated pension valuation calculator
- Latest market trends affecting buyout rates
- New case studies from recent clients
- Step-by-step guide to the buyout process

If this isn't relevant anymore, that's okay too. I just want to make sure we're not cluttering your inbox.

TWO OPTIONS:

1) YES, KEEP ME UPDATED
   {{keepSubscribedUrl}}

2) UNSUBSCRIBE ME
   {{unsubscribeUrl}}

Either way, I appreciate you giving us a chance.

Best regards,
The FedBuyOut Team

P.S. If you're just overwhelmed by email frequency, you can update your preferences to receive only monthly updates:
