**Title:** I built a free federal buyout calculator - would love your feedback

Hi everyone! I'm a federal employee (15 years FERS) and I noticed there's a lot of confusion when buyout offers come around about whether to take them or stay for the pension.

I built a free calculator that compares your options side-by-side:

✅ FERS/CSRS pension calculations with High-3
✅ Buyout tax implications (federal + state)
✅ Break-even analysis (how long until pension catches up)
✅ Early retirement penalties if under MRA
✅ Survivor benefit costs
✅ Military buyback impact

**Check it out:** https://fedbuyout.com

It's completely free, no email required to use (though there's a newsletter if you want updates).

I've tested it against OPM calculations and it's accurate, but I'd love feedback from this community on:
- What features would you find helpful?
- Any edge cases I might have missed?
- Would this be useful for your colleagues?

Also happy to answer any buyout/pension questions - I've researched this stuff way too much 😅

Thanks!
