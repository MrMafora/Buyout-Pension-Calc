    "description": "The unusual nature of the funding lapse has led to some confusion for impacted federal workers.",
    "content": "<p>Federal employees across parts of government went or stayed home on Monday, furloughed for the second time in three months even as lawmakers scramble to reopen agencies within the next 24 hours.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Senate late Friday approved a spending package to fund most of the agencies that have not yet received full-year appropriations, while keeping the Homeland Security Department afloat with a two-week stopgap continuing resolution. The House was on recess at the time and hoped to quickly pass the measure Monday, but House Democrats appear to have blocked that timetable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead, House Republicans are aiming to approve the package in the Rules Committee on Monday in hopes of teeing up a simple majority vote Tuesday. There is some concern that the bill could run into roadblocks, as some Republicans have also threatened to withhold their support if the measure is not further amended.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Office of Management and Budget on Friday informed agencies a funding lapse would occur and they should <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2026/01/white-house-initiate-shutdown-process-congress-hopes-keep-duration-minimal/411100/?oref=ge-home-top-story\">initiate shutdown procedures</a>. Agencies took varying approaches over the weekend and on Monday, leading to some confusion over exactly how employees should proceed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Internal Revenue Service, as it did in the shutdown that began in October, told employees they would use carryover funds this week, and all employees should &ldquo;report to work on their normal schedules,&rdquo; according to an email sent to staff. Much of DHS, as is typical, was &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; or &ldquo;exempted&rdquo; from the shutdown, either due to the nature of their work or because their funding comes from non-appropriated sources, such as fees charged by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Federal Aviation Administration and Housing and Urban Development Department, however, were among agencies that already began furloughing employees on Monday, impacted workers told <em>Government Executive</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies, such as the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration, are currently experiencing a funding lapse.</p> <p>FAA has furloughed around 10,000 employees, according to an updated contingency plan the agency posted just before the lapse began. Impacted staff were notified of their furlough status on Sunday and required to report to their offices to put up out of office messages and other steps required as part of their &ldquo;orderly shutdown procedures,&rdquo; according to one impacted worker.&nbsp;</p> <p>HHS on Friday told employees to report on Monday to initiate the shutdown, according to emails obtained by <em>Government Executive</em>. On Monday morning at 3 a.m., however, the department changed course and told furloughed workers they could instead take those steps remotely. Many employees still reported because they had not seen the message or had not yet received permission to telework from their supervisors, and were directed to return home shortly after arriving in the office.&nbsp;</p> <p>One employee said they were told on Friday they would be &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; from the shutdown, only to be told subsequently that they would instead be furloughed.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the fate of the funding bill remains uncertain, House Republican leaders on Monday expressed confidence that they would be able to clear Monday&rsquo;s procedural hurdle and send the package to President Trump&rsquo;s desk on Tuesday. Trump has declared his support for the bill.&nbsp;</p> <p>The original deal fell apart after DHS law enforcement personnel fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minnesota earlier this month, leading Democrats to balk at providing the department with its full funding without additional reforms. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has laid out his caucus&rsquo; demands for changes at DHS, including the removal of masks by DHS law enforcement personnel, mandated use of body cameras, a requirement for third-party warrants to enter homes, the end of roving patrols in metropolitan areas by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and more uniform restrictions on use of force by federal agents. Democrats plan to negotiate over those items with the White House while the two-week DHS CR is in effect.</p> <div class=\"related-articles-placeholder\">[[Related Posts]]</div> <p></p>",

    "description": "The Government Accountability Office also reported that the caseload for the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights increased by an average of 98 cases per week during part of the time that these staffers were on paid leave.",
    "content": "<p>The Government Accountability Office found in <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-26-108320.pdf\">a Monday report</a> that the Education Department spent $28.5 million to $38 million on nine months of paid leave for employees in its Office for Civil Rights before ultimately reinstating them to their positions.&nbsp;</p> <p>In March, the Education Department undertook workforce reductions as part of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s efforts to downsize the civil service as well as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-empowering-parents-states-and-communities/\">an executive order</a> for the Education secretary to &ldquo;take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure&rdquo; of the agency. Eliminating the department would require congressional authorization.&nbsp;</p> <p>Between reductions in force and buyouts, <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/02/rif-watch-see-which-agencies-are-laying-federal-workers/403342/?oref=ge-skybox-hp\">the administration halved Education&rsquo;s workforce</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>OCR, which enforces federal civil rights laws at educational institutions, also lost 299&nbsp;of its 575 staffers as a result of the March RIFs and closed seven of its 12 regional offices.&nbsp;</p> <p>Impacted employees were supposed to be officially separated in June, but their terminations were delayed by multiple preliminary injunctions brought about from several federal lawsuits. Then, in December, Education brought back 85 OCR staffers and rescinded the remaining RIF notices in January.&nbsp;</p> <p>While that played out, affected OCR employees weren&rsquo;t allowed to work and were put on paid leave. Based on court filings, GAO determined that Education spent $28.5 million to $38 million compensating such individuals between March and December.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;For more than nine months, Education Secretary Linda McMahon sidelined hundreds of employees at the Office for Civil Rights from the critical work of protecting our nation&rsquo;s most vulnerable students and families, while costing American taxpayers up to $38 million and mounting a massive backlog of complaints from parents and students,&rdquo; said Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education employees. &ldquo;Instead of following court orders and federal law, the Trump Administration chose to keep these civil rights professionals on paid administrative leave rather than letting them do their jobs, while students, families and schools paid the price.&rdquo;</p> <p>GAO reported, based on Education&rsquo;s most recent data, that OCR&rsquo;s caseload increased by an average of 98 cases per week between June 27 and Sept. 23.&nbsp;</p> <p>Investigators also faulted the department for not being able to show that its analysis of the RIFs at OCR addressed all potential costs and savings associated with them. Specifically, they said officials neglected to consider the costs of severance pay, unemployment insurance and handling appeals or grievances.</p> <p>&ldquo;By not demonstrating that its analyses accounted for all potential costs and savings, and by not documenting such analyses, Education lacks reasonable assurance that its RIF actions achieved the stated goal of reforming the federal workforce to maximize efficiency and productivity,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;Specifically, Education cannot ensure that OCR improved service to the American people, increased productivity or reduced its overall budget for fiscal years 2025 through 2027 with its actions.&rdquo;</p> <p>GAO recommended that Education estimate the total costs and savings associated with its March RIFs, but the department disagreed. Officials argued that because OCR staffers were reinstated that such an analysis is unnecessary.&nbsp;</p> <p>Investigators also reported that, between March and September, OCR received more than 9,000 complaints, resolving about 7,000 of them. Roughly 90% of the resolved cases were dismissed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Between 2010 and 2020, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104341.pdf\">dismissal was the most common outcome</a> of resolved OCR complaints regarding alleged hostile behaviors, ranging from about half to around 80%, according to a 2021 GAO report. That report noted that the dismissals occurred for a variety of reasons, the most common being that OCR &ldquo;did not receive consent to disclose the name of the complainant.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pursuant to the directive calling for its elimination, Education has detailed dozens of its employees to other departments. Staffers told <em>Government Executive</em>, however, that the <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2026/01/education-begins-moving-out-employees-even-congress-says-it-lacks-authority/410806/\">transfers, so far, effectively amount to a change in physical location</a> rather than an alteration of work or chain of command.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/11/new-watchdog-education-department-may-have-shared-pro-trump-social-media-posts/409474/\">Trump has twice replaced the acting inspector general for the Education Department</a>.

    "content": "<p>The two federal immigration agents who fired on Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti are identified in government records as Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez.</p> <p>The records viewed by ProPublica list Ochoa, 43, and Gutierrez, 35, as the shooters during the deadly encounter last weekend that left Pretti dead and ignited massive protests and calls for criminal investigations.</p> <p>Both men were assigned to Operation Metro Surge, an immigration enforcement dragnet launched in December that sent scores of armed and masked agents across the city.</p> <p>CBP, which employs both men, has so far refused to release their names and has disclosed few other facts about the deadly incident, which came days after a different immigration agent shot and killed another Minneapolis protester, a 37-year-old mother of three named Renee Good.</p> <p>Pretti&rsquo;s killing, and the subsequent secrecy surrounding the agents involved, comes as the country confronts the consequences of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s aggressive immigration crackdown. The sweeps in cities across the country have been marked by scenes of violence, against immigrants and U.S. citizens, by agents allowed to hide their identities with masks &mdash; an almost unheard of practice in law enforcement. As a result, the public has been kept from one of the chief ways it has to hold officers involved in such altercations accountable: their identity.</p> <p>Both Democratic and <a href=\"https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/2015247523003162922\">Republican</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/25/g-s1-107288/senate-investigation-alex-pretti-killing\">lawmakers</a> have called for a transparent investigation into the killing of Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse working at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital.</p> <p>&ldquo;We must have a transparent, independent investigation into the Minnesota shooting, and those responsible&mdash;no matter their title&mdash;must be held accountable,&rdquo; Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/SenJohnCurtis/status/2015881366546559019\">wrote on X</a> on Monday.</p> <p>The agency sent a notice to some members of Congress on Tuesday acknowledging that two agents fired Glock pistols during the altercation that left Pretti dead. That notice does not include the agents&rsquo; names. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said the agents had been placed on leave after the Jan. 24 shooting. And after a week of protests and calls from lawmakers for a review, the Justice Department said Friday that its Civil Rights Division is investigating the shooting. A DOJ spokesperson did not answer questions, including whether DHS has shared materials, such as body-camera footage, with its investigators.</p> <p>Ochoa is a Border Patrol agent who joined CBP in 2018. Gutierrez joined in 2014 and works for CBP&rsquo;s Office of Field Operations. He is assigned to a special response team, which conducts high-risk operations like those of police SWAT units. Records show both men are from South Texas.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the shooting, Gregory Bovino, who has orchestrated high-intensity immigration sweeps and arrests in a string of Democratic-led cities since early 2025, was removed from his role as Border Patrol commander at large and reassigned to his former post in El Centro, California.</p> <p>A spokesperson for DHS declined to answer questions about the two agents and referred ProPublica to the FBI. The FBI declined to comment. ProPublica made several attempts to call Ochoa and Gutierrez but neither answered.</p> <p>Ochoa, who goes by Jesse, graduated from the University of Texas-Pan American with a degree in criminal justice, according to his ex-wife, Angelica Ochoa. A longtime resident of the Rio Grande Valley, Ochoa had for years dreamed of working for the Border Patrol and finally landed a job there, she said. By the time the couple split in 2021, he had become a gun enthusiast with about 25 rifles, pistols and shotguns, Angelica Ochoa said.</p> <p>DHS&rsquo; disclosure to Congress was drawn from an internal review of the agents&rsquo; body-camera footage, which has not been released to the public. State investigators, meanwhile, have accused their federal counterparts of blocking them from investigating the shooting.</p> <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any information on the shooters,&rdquo; a Minneapolis city spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday that his office also had &ldquo;not been given the names, and we don&rsquo;t have any new information on the investigation.&rdquo;</p> <p>Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, <a href=\"https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2026-01-26-raskin-et-al-to-bondi-doj-re-good-and-pretti-investigations_0.pdf\">in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi Monday</a>, accused the Justice Department of covering up evidence in both Pretti&rsquo;s and Good&rsquo;s killings.</p> <p>&ldquo;DOJ has also blocked prosecutors and agents from cooperating with state law enforcement officials and prevented state officials from accessing evidence,&rdquo; the letter said.</p> <p>Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN on Sunday that immigration agents should not be masked.</p> <p>&ldquo;They should not be anonymous. They should be identifiable. And they have to have rules of engagement that don&rsquo;t allow them to terrorize and intimidate, harass and assault U.S. citizens and other people,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>The notice to Congress said that the shooting happened when Pretti resisted arrest after officers were unable to get him and a female protester out of the street.</p> <p>The CBP officer &ldquo;attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move,&rdquo; the report reads. &ldquo;CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel&rsquo;s efforts and a struggle ensued.&rdquo;</p> <p>According to the report, one agent then yelled &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a gun!&rdquo; multiple times, and two others &ldquo;discharged&rdquo; their Glock pistols.</p> <p>In videos widely shared online, Pretti can be seen holding up a phone, documenting the movements of federal agents and officers as they roamed the streets of a popular food and arts district. According to news reports, Pretti was concerned about the increasingly volatile siege of the city by federal agents.</p> <p>In the videos, a masked agent appears to knock a woman to the ground. Pretti comes to her aid, getting between them, at which point the officer deploys pepper spray at his face. Two agents then grab Pretti and pull him to the ground, while more federal personnel pile on. During the struggle, the agents unleash a series of shots &mdash; approximately 10 &mdash; as onlookers scream.</p> <p>Pretti was armed at the time of the encounter with a legally owned handgun, according to state and federal officials. Some analyses of bystander video appear to show a federal agent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010668660/new-video-analysis-reveals-flawed-and-fatal-decisions-in-shooting-of-pretti.html\">taking Pretti&rsquo;s gun</a> from his hip before the first shots were fired. The agents&rsquo; masks and the chaos of the altercation make it difficult to differentiate one from another.</p> <p>Those videos appear to contradict the claims by Bovino and other officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, that Pretti had come to attack agents.</p> <p>&ldquo;The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted,&rdquo; Bovino said in a Jan. 25 news conference. &ldquo;Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a Border Patrol agent fired defensive shots.&rdquo;</p> <p>In the initial aftermath, Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide and a leading force behind the immigration enforcement operations, called Pretti &ldquo;a would-be assassin.&rdquo; But Miller changed tack later in the week when he said <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/politics/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-trump\">in a statement</a> that CBP officers &ldquo;may not have been following&rdquo; protocol related to confronting bystanders.</p> <p>Additional video has surfaced showing Pretti in another altercation with federal agents 11 days before he was killed. The video shows Pretti yelling at the agents, who get in an SUV and start to drive away. Pretti then kicks out the taillight of the vehicle and the agents, who wore protective masks, jump out and tackle him to the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is unclear if any of the same agents were involved in both incidents.</p> <p>Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said that many local and state police departments are &ldquo;much more transparent&rdquo; than CBP when officers shoot people. &ldquo;More and more police departments are choosing to release bodycam footage or dashcam footage within a couple of days.&rdquo;</p> <p>Gil Kerlikowske, a former CBP commissioner, told ProPublica that it&rsquo;s difficult to draw conclusions from the chaos in bystander videos. Still, he said, the shooting might have been prevented. Pretti&rsquo;s attempt to help the woman knocked to the ground could have been seen as interfering with federal law enforcement, he said. But the decision by the officers to immediately use pepper spray created a chaotic scene that likely contributed to Pretti&rsquo;s death.</p> <p>&ldquo;The other agent could have said &lsquo;don&rsquo;t interfere&rsquo; or &lsquo;stand back,&rsquo;&rdquo; Kerlikowske said. &ldquo;Rather than move immediately to pepper spray, you can arrest the person.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s part of a pattern, he said, of federal officers <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-border-patrol-less-lethal-weapons\">jumping straight to use of force</a> in situations that could have been de-escalated but instead create danger for both agents and their targets.</p> <p>Pretti&rsquo;s death, and the federal government&rsquo;s characterization of the event, sparked immediate protests, spurring thousands of people to go out into frigid conditions in Minneapolis and other American cities. The shooting has also drawn intense criticism from political leaders, including Walz, who has promised his state&rsquo;s law enforcement will conduct its own criminal investigation.</p> <link href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alex-pretti-shooting-cbp-agents-identified-jesus-ochoa-raymundo-gutierrez\" rel=\"canonical\" /><meta name=\"syndication-source\" content=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alex-pretti-shooting-cbp-agents-identified-jesus-ochoa-raymundo-gutierrez\" /><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pixel.propublica.org/pixel.js\" async></script>",

Those problems include functioning effectively with a reduced staff, administering federal benefit plans, modernizing its IT systems and the need to upgrade the federal HR systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>OPM has taken steps to change the management of performance &ndash; the Senior Executive Service was &ldquo;overhauled,&rdquo; performance standards were changed, there is the plan to &ldquo;limit top ratings,&rdquo; along with &ldquo;meaningful bonuses and awards.&rdquo; Additionally, OPM is implementing &ldquo;one HR system&rdquo; &ndash; Federal HR 2.0 &ndash; to consolidate workforce information. Director Kupor summarized the changes in a recent release to OPM team members, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/news/from-the-director-s-desk/changes-at-opm-building-a-high-performance-culture/\">Changes at OPM: Building a High Performance Culture</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The &ldquo;nuts-and-bolts&rdquo; changes are clearly important. However, missing from the recent releases are important discussions of the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; issues like leadership, behavioral change, capability building and psychological safety. There is also no reference to the obvious importance of new technology and the problems building employee capabilities using new IT systems. And perhaps most important is the problem unique to larger organizations &ndash; the cultural transformation from compliance to high performance.</p> <p>For reasons embedded a century ago, the administration of government&rsquo;s HR system has never been linked to agency performance. That was true in President Clinton&rsquo;s &quot;reinventing government&rdquo; &ndash; despite the performance gains and the Hammer Awards - and through the years on Performance.gov. The new head of the General Services Administration reinforced that when he referred to his agency as &ldquo;the engine room that makes the mission run.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>McKinsey, however, has a different perspective as discussed in their report, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/performance-through-people-transforming-human-capital-into-competitive-advantage\">Performance through people: Transforming human capital into competitive advantage</a>.&rdquo; Gallup agrees &ndash; when expectations are clear, feedback is frequent and accountability is real, organizations outperform peers. The investment pays off.</p> <p>Related studies confirm the linkage of the HR practices associated with a &ldquo;high-performance culture&rdquo; and an organization&rsquo;s success. It&rsquo;s captured by comparisons of the lists of the best places to work and the lists of the best performing organizations. On the&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;list of the best places to work, the top 10 are or are close to the most successful in their industries.&nbsp;</p> <p>To transition to a high-performance culture, government will need to understand the emerging issues now influencing performance. Research and experience in other sectors make it clear &ndash; workforce management is changing and agencies will need to understand and address the new issues, led by the COVID changes, the unplanned staff reductions and now by new IT systems.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Understanding High Performance Organizations</strong></p> <p>Government cannot be a High Performance Organization since the phrase refers to organizations that perform better than their peers. Further, the HPO concept is a construct to facilitate understanding and discussion of what enables complex organizations to perform at high levels.</p> <p>The research&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hpocenter.com/hpo-framework/\">by the research/academic HPO Center</a>&nbsp;shows that there is &ldquo;a direct and positive relationship&rdquo; between a list of 35 common characteristics, organized into five factors, and an organization&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s significant&nbsp;that 28 of the 35 involve human behavior.&nbsp;Their analyses show the five factors are consistently linked across industry sectors and countries.</p> <ul> <li>HPO factor 1: Management Quality &ndash; &ldquo;Managers in an HPO work with integrity and . . . show commitment, enthusiasm and respect. . . HPO managers coach and facilitate employees to achieve better results by being supportive, helping them, protecting them from outside interference and by being available to them.&rdquo;</li> <li>HPO factor 2: Openness &amp; Action Orientation &ndash; &ldquo;In an HPO, management values the opinion of employees by frequently having dialogues with them and involving them in all important business and organizational processes. HPO management allows experiments . . . and seeing mistakes as an opportunity to learn.&rdquo;</li> <li>HPO factor 3: Long-Term Orientation &ndash; &ldquo;An HPO creates a safe and secure workplace by giving people a sense of safety and job security and by using dismissal as a last resort. They grow new management from their own ranks by encouraging staff to become leaders . . .&rdquo;</li> <li>HPO factor 4: Continuous Improvement &amp; Renewal &ndash; &ldquo;It continuously simplifies, improves and aligns all its processes . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization also measures and reports everything that matters . . . People in an HPO feel a moral obligation to continuously strive for the best results.&rdquo;</li> <li>HPO factor 5: Employee Quality &ndash; &ldquo;An HPO makes sure it assembles a diverse and complementary workforce and recruits people with maximum flexibility . . . An HPO continuously works on the development of its workforce by training staff to be resilient and flexible, . . . inspiring them to improve their skills . . .&rdquo;</li> </ul> <p>The 28&nbsp;characteristics may be &ldquo;soft&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;Managers are confident and trusted by employees&rdquo;) but they are universally understood and intuitively relevant to good performance. The factors capture a work environment that attracts talent and supports effective public service.</p> <p>The research is consistent with the arguments supporting a related construct, &ldquo;healthy organizations.&rdquo; That was the focus of a NAPA report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://napawash.org/academy-studies/strengthening-organizational-health-and-performance-in-government\">&ldquo;Strengthening Organizational Health and Performance in Government.&rdquo;</a></p> <p>McKinsey has also focused on &ldquo;organizational health&rdquo;. Its studies show healthy companies show three times the total shareholder return than less-healthy companies.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/a-fitness-agenda-for-government-cultivating-organizational-health-in-the-us-public-sector\">It argues</a>:</p> <p>&ldquo;US government agencies also stand to gain considerable benefits from boosting organizational health. Key focus areas for leaders could include instilling a focus on purpose among employees; creating a supportive work environment that encourages innovation, autonomy, and ownership; nurturing talent development and deployment; and motivating staff through recognition and career opportunities.</p> <p>Further research is not needed &ndash; creating &ldquo;healthy organizations&rdquo; benefits organizations and their employees. On that point, public sector employees are no different than those working in other sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The barriers to realizing gains</strong></p> <p>Despite the recommendations over the years, government&rsquo;s human capital framework has been immutable. In the era when it was conceived, employers expected employees to follow orders. That approach to management is still evident in all but a few state and local government &ldquo;merit&rdquo; systems as well.</p> <p>There are exceptions, however &ndash; the long list of demonstration projects and &ldquo;alternative personnel systems&rdquo;. They confirm change is possible. The practices loosely aligned with HPOs can gain acceptance in government agencies. GAO is the most prominent. The agency has consistently led the Partnership&rsquo;s list of the Best Places to Work for mid-size agencies.</p> <p>The &ldquo;system&rdquo; barriers include the General Schedule and its administrative practices, the outdated approach to selecting and training new managers and the inability of the political leaders to agree on the need for reform. Through the years OPM was seen as a roadblock to change. It&rsquo;s telling that, until recently, the need to improve agency performance was not addressed on OPM&rsquo;s website.</p> <p>An unrecognized barrier is the typical background of the individuals who run for election. Few have had successful careers managing or leading large organizations. In owner-managed businesses, the old top-down, &ldquo;do-as-you&rsquo;re-told&rdquo; approach to management is still common. That approach, however, is never successful in government &ndash; or in any complex organization, especially in this era of dynamic change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Notably, Elon Musk epitomizes the top-down approach. He is reported to prefer to personally direct major decisions, move fast and override traditional organizational structures. His tough management style is offset by lucrative stock-related incentives for executives and employees.</p> <p>Musk&rsquo;s disdain for government regulation is documented. He was quoted in Politico, &ldquo;DOGE is the wood chipper for bureaucracy.&rdquo; The blanket staff reductions added new barriers. There have been reports of skill gaps, inadequate staffing, employee burnout and the loss of operational knowledge. Most important, Federal News Network has reported the job losses have &ldquo;destroyed workforce morale&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;schedules are slipping&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;trust is . . .at an all-time low.&rdquo;</p> <p>The cancellation of the 2025 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey makes it clear OPM is aware of the problems.</p> <p><strong>People remain the key to high performance</strong></p> <p>The unexpected staff reductions affect both those who lost their jobs as well as those who continue working.&nbsp;The latter often suffer from what is close to &ldquo;survivor syndrome&quot; when they feel a sense of guilt and disengagement having survived the traumatic termination of co-workers.&nbsp;Addressing the &ldquo;aftershocks&rdquo; is not damage control; it&rsquo;s about rebuilding psychological safety and commitment. Cash incentives could help but not when employees have to &ldquo;compete&rdquo; for the awards.</p> <p>Government&rsquo;s heightened workforce problems are not unique.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/the-race-to-regain-trust-in-2026\">Research by Korn Ferry</a>&nbsp;shows &ldquo;Less than half, 48%, of employees trust their senior leaders . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>Agencies would do well to conduct a similar survey or rely on Employee Resource Groups to understand how the staffing changes have impacted their commitment to their agency&rsquo;s mission. Korn Ferry argues employers need &ldquo;the trust of their employees to roll out massive strategies around AI and successfully execute [organizational changes] . . .&rdquo; It goes beyond AI of course.&nbsp;</p> <p>Employees want to use their experience to solve local operational problems but only if they feel their ideas will be valued. The success of the demonstration projects confirms in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; work setting employees do not hesitate to commit to their unit&rsquo;s success. But in the current work climate, significant gains &ndash; and the goal of a high-performance culture &ndash; are now &ldquo;a bridge too far.&rdquo; Consistent with the Korn Ferry point, the level of mutual distrust is a barrier to change.&nbsp;</p> <p>The heightened emphasis on AI is certainly justified. It can be a performance multiplier when used effectively to accelerate and improve decisions. It also can eliminate low value activities. It&rsquo;s best seen as a tool to support manager-employee discussions, and raise performance expectations in goal setting.&nbsp;</p> <p>AI supports improved performance but employee &ldquo;soft&rdquo; skills &ndash; collaboration, communication, judgement, adaptability, etc. &ndash; explain why certain employees are high performers. Investing in training pays off. The essential soft skills depend on the mission (e.g., medical care, law enforcement) and the nature of the operating problems. Those skills also enhance manager coaching and mentoring.</p> <p>The investment needed to improve performance is discussed in the ebook, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/assets/preparing-managers-tomorrows-government-ge-q4-2020/portal/?afd_azwaf_tok=eyJraWQiOiI0QkFCNDRENzg3N0FBQkE3OTY1RkJEMkVCNEQ3NUZCRkQ2QjdCRkVFOThEMkFBRkM0ODZGQTMzNEYyQzVBNzlBIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJ3d3cuZ292ZXhlYy5jb20iLCJleHAiOjE3Njk4MDEzMDEsImlhdCI6MTc2OTgwMTI5MSwiaXNzIjoidGllcjEtNWJkNzY2NjdkNS16bnFneCIsInN1YiI6IjI2OjQwNDA6YzYyZDplNzpjODcwOjI4YzU6NDAxOTpiMzFjIiwiZGF0YSI6eyJ0eXBlIjoiaXNzdWVkIiwicmVmIjoiMjAyNjAxMzBUMTkyODExWi0xNWJkNzY2NjdkNXpucWd4aEMxQkwxZDEwZzAwMDAwMDBhcGcwMDAwMDAwMHB1YzUiLCJiIjoiRF9NUHdsQXBwc0JkdFRXSGdCYV9MVHZjNEVJclgzeXFhZ0NNVzh6dGxPbyIsImgiOiJ2STR2NDE2Rlk3TTRSdlRfajFCdUNHZmU0QWZrNmM5LWZHZFczMHVRcG5JIn19.4vMMovuwn0ysNbunzBAVr3NTIcjRsheo7WFAsvCI27ioVYkOAAOhgGeXN6yr0n7Eq9aYZZ_KVafevKbHeFv8im1Vrklr1f8orVDKKOW3kkhxriF2A_iy7kfltjLOj66hby1zEZB4JW-mQ8FNAGzBpy9a-CptJsaVFyYvAAIWZVX4a1K67MkB5VIFvjqkViCORJ-3L2joW0MwMuWroRithxGy88dlOyJ9zQR1osrcmUIrlbBnKMFd4QcYwq1gjtZAXRZqsQfMrhB5JrItbdAGp-2yJ004cwuuKpcCV3WNLMu8UFM88jtzXlueydMr9PBVjhHmgw22pt9aBy4KgYT4IQ.WF3obl2IDtqgvMFRqVdYkD5s\">Preparing Managers for Tomorrow&rsquo;s Government</a>&rdquo;.

    "content": "<p>A new report from a nonpartisan good-government organization warned that the adoption of a plan to strip federal workers in policy-related positions of their civil service protections would not fulfill the Trump administration&rsquo;s stated ambitions of making agencies more effective and responsive, and could instead cost hundreds of millions of dollars in increased recruitment and training spending.</p> <p>The Partnership for Public Service this week released a <a href=\"https://ourpublicservice.org/publications/at-will-employment-what-the-federal-government-can-learn-from-states/?utm_campaign=28824957-Reimagining%20Government%20Website&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8arwTtP8e8Bf-HNlZ4JhxvmtWaBqcqU_anbD-5cCKAd0Oq7ffHnTarm6V8cXGbyQKjQudKqAkb2k65R1GZoCxYrpPlfQ&amp;_hsmi=400635617&amp;utm_content=400635617&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">report examining at-will employment</a> in state governments, in light of the impending <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/topic/schedule-f/\">revival of Schedule F</a>&mdash;since renamed Schedule Policy/Career&mdash;which would forcibly convert tens of thousands of federal workers in &ldquo;policy-related&rdquo; jobs out of the competitive service, effectively making them at-will employees. The Trump administration is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/11/final-schedule-f-regulations-describe-civil-service-protections-unconstitutional-overcorrections/409616/?oref=ge-topic-lander-featured-river\">issue a final rule</a> implementing the policy in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The Partnership found that while supporters of Schedule F&mdash;or implementing at-will employment more broadly at federal agencies&mdash;often tout the successes of state governments like Florida, Texas and Missouri, it is hard to isolate what impact at-will employment had on state and local agencies, because it is typically undertaken alongside a bevy of other policies under the banner of civil service reform.</p> <p>&ldquo;These broader sets of changes demonstrate that lawmakers did not view the transition to at-will employment as an end goal in and of itself,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;Instead, it was viewed as one tool in a menu of personnel system changes . . . Proponents of at-will employment at times mistakenly draw conclusions about the effects of at-will employment by looking at evidence from the whole body of changes undertaken by state governments.&rdquo;</p> <p>Indeed, academic surveys of state and local HR officials in jurisdictions with at-will employment generally have not reported an improvement to efficiency or government services.</p> <p>A 2014 survey of HR professionals in six states with at-will employment found only 20% agreed with the notion that the policy made employees more productive. And more than 30% of HR officials in four at-will employment states in a 2010 survey reported that the policy was utilized more to remove competent workers than poor performers.</p> <p>&ldquo;A similar percentage agreed that it had resulted in employees being terminated because of personality conflicts with management,&rdquo; the Partnership wrote. &ldquo;In Georgia, over 30% of HR professionals [in 2010] agreed that employees in their agency had been terminated for politically motivated reasons. [And] Professor Ben Goehring [at the University of Virginia] found that Gov. Jeb Bush and his appointees removed at-will employees from Florida&rsquo;s Department of Education after the agency was reorganized in 2001 to be more under the governor&rsquo;s control.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Partnership also found that in states with full or nearly entirely at-will employment have much higher turnover than federal agencies. In Texas, attrition in government tops 16%, compared to the federal government&rsquo;s 5.9% turnover, as of 2023. In Missouri, the attrition rate was as high as 29% in 2022.</p> <p>&ldquo;In the private sector, the cost to replace an employee has been found to range from 50% to 400% of the employee&rsquo;s salary, depending on the role and level of experience and specialized skills,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;A significantly increased turnover rate for the tens of thousands of employees that would be covered under Schedule Policy/Career could cost the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars every year.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Partnership also found that states that have deployed at-will employment upon their governmental workforces tend to have been politically stable, in that one political party&mdash;usually Republicans&mdash;perennially dominate both the statehouse and governor&rsquo;s mansion. Don Kettl, professor emeritus at the University of Maryland and former dean of its School of Public Policy, said the federal government&rsquo;s more frequent vacillations between which political party is in power could further complicate matters.</p> <p>&ldquo;That particularly means that states run by Republicans have within them bigger problems and worries and concerns about an entrenched bureaucracy making it harder for them to get where they want to go, as well as less worry about what the opposing party might do if and when they get into power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;[The] idea that at-will employment is a strategy for managerial change, as opposed to one for political control is at the heart of all of this. And this paper underlines that it is far more about political control than it is effectiveness.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p><i>Updated Jan. 31 at 9:17 a.m.</i></p> <p>The Senate on Friday evening approved&nbsp;a spending package that ensures nearly all agencies are funding through fiscal 2026, but the agreement&nbsp;came too late to stave off an appropriations lapse.&nbsp;</p> <p>Parts of the government are poised to shut down at midnight and the White House said it must go through the formal procedures that accompany that outcome, despite a resolution appearing imminent. The House is still in recess and will not return until Monday, meaning funding cannot be restored until that afternoon at the earliest.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;We have been sending guidance to agencies this week, including today, on the likely lapse in funding,&rdquo; an Office of Management and Budget spokesperson said on Friday. They added that OMB was following the &ldquo;normal shutdown process&rdquo; and would send a memorandum later on Friday instructing them to kick off shutdown procedures. Agencies would then notify employees who will be deemed excepted&mdash;and would therefore have to work during the shutdown&mdash;and who will be furloughed.</p> <p>OMB Director Russ Vought issued the memo late Friday instructing agencies to &quot;execute plans for an orderly shutdown,&quot; adding it was the administration&#39;s hope &quot;that this lapse will be short.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Senate Democrats and the White House came to an agreement late Thursday to fund the vast majority of federal agencies, while providing a two-week stopgap continuing resolution to the Homeland Security Department. Passage of that bill was delayed Thursday night and into Friday as lawmakers negotiated over which amendments to attach the package. Senators reached&nbsp;such a deal late in the afternoon on Friday and passed the bill that evening, allowing the House to vote as soon as it returns next week.</p> <p>The deal came hours after eight Republicans joined all Democrats in defeating a previous measure, which the House had approved with broad bipartisan support. It was set to coast to President Trump&rsquo;s desk until Border Patrol agents fatally shot Alex Pretti on Jan. 24, leading to demands from Senate Democrats that more restrictions be placed on the Homeland Security Department&rsquo;s immigration enforcement efforts as part of the agency&rsquo;s funding bill.</p> <p>The bill would fully fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies. The remaining federal agencies previously received their full-year appropriations and are not at risk of shutting down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Current funding for those agencies subject to the new bill is set to expire at the end of the day Friday. Those agencies will see their appropriations lapse at midnight, though the impact of the shutdown could depend on when the House acts. OMB stressed on Friday it does not have the authority to stave off the impacts of a shutdown simply because a vote is expected to occur.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2018, funding briefly expired for agencies and OMB declared the impasse was merely a &ldquo;short, technical lapse.&rdquo; It provided agencies flexibility in implementing shutdown procedures due to the imminence of a resolution, though the situation <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/2018/02/short-lived-shutdown-sparks-confusion-across-federal-agencies/145872/\">created widespread confusion</a> across the government.</p> <p>All federal employees who would normally report to work on Feb. 2 would be expected to do so anyway, as is standard practice on the first working day after a funding lapse to initiate &ldquo;orderly shutdown activities.&rdquo; Depending on when the House acts, OMB could advise furloughed employees to remain at work or to go home and await an update.&nbsp;</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has laid out his caucus&rsquo; demands for DHS reforms, including the removal of masks by DHS law enforcement personnel, mandated use of body cameras, a requirement for third-party warrants to enter homes, the end of roving patrols in metropolitan areas by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and more uniform restrictions on use of force by federal agents. Democrats plan to negotiate over those items with the White House while the two-week DHS CR is in effect.</p> <p><em>This story has been updated with new information on the status of appropriations.</em></p>",

    "content": "<p>Combating fraud in government programs has been a talking point for the White House since the start of the second Trump administration, most&nbsp;recently with a focus on an ongoing social services fraud scandal in Minnesota.&nbsp;</p> <p>But experts say that the administration is making the problem worse, not better, by making false claims, dismantling the government&rsquo;s watchdogs, using fraud as a pretext for political goals&nbsp;and more.</p> <p><strong>&#39;The specter of a politicized inspector general community&#39;</strong></p> <p>Days after taking office in 2025, Trump broke norms &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/09/fired-watchdogs-cant-be-reinstated-despite-trumps-obvious-law-breaking-court-decides/408387/\">and law</a>, according to a federal judge &mdash; by dismissing nearly 20 inspectors general, whose very jobs are to combat waste, fraud and abuse in the government.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;President Trump&#39;s firing of IGs and removal of acting IGs, and then the subsequent appointment of some <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2026/01/most-newly-confirmed-trump-inspectors-general-have-previously-worked-his-administration-raising-fears-about-independent-agency-oversight/410657/?oref=ge-author-river\">very political folks</a> as IGs &hellip; does raise the specter of a politicized inspector general community,&rdquo; one of those fired watchdogs, Mark Lee Greenblatt, told <em>Nextgov/FCW.</em>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;That is a major concern,&rdquo; said Greenblatt, who was the Interior Department&rsquo;s inspector general until Trump dismissed him days after taking office.&nbsp;</p> <p>The risk in firing IGs and appointing new ones at the start of a new administration is that these apolitical, independent organizations may favor one administration or another, or pursue partisan attacks, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>That&rsquo;s a worry shared by Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, who recently told reporters that he&rsquo;s worried the administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;hunt for waste&rdquo; will become a &ldquo;mechanism to pursue enemies.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;This administration utilizes the clothing of good government without the substance of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Firing [these inspectors general] for no good reason was the clearest sign that, in fact, waste is not their goal here. Control is their goal. Their choices have been entirely designed to maximize their ability to remove anybody that will get in their way of doing what they want, irrespective of the legality or the constitutionality of their action.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Concerns of &#39;co-opting&#39; fraud prevention</strong></p> <p>The administration&rsquo;s creation of a new fraud-focused associate deputy attorney general has also sparked concerns about politicized investigations.</p> <p>Beyond removing watchdogs, Trump&rsquo;s White House has also cited fraud for a variety of its most controversial actions.</p> <p>The administration has been &ldquo;co-opting&rdquo; the word fraud, said Linda Miller, an anti-fraud expert who worked at the Government Accountability Office &mdash; Congress&rsquo;s oversight arm &mdash; for a decade.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dismaying, to put it mildly,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>The Trump administration pointed to fraud as rationale for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development last year, for example. Many of those claims were <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/collections/trump-usaid-funding/\">false or misleading</a>, Snopes assessed.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fraud if you don&rsquo;t agree with how the administration before you spent money,&rdquo; said Miller. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a difference of agreement on policy priorities.&rdquo;</p> <p>This month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/federal-agents-minnesota-ice-shooting.html?smid=url-share\">cited</a> an ongoing welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota as a reason to send more federal agencies to Minneapolis to support the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.</p> <p>The same day that federal agents fatally shot Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115951636521315703\">accused</a> Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and other politicians in the state of &ldquo;inciting Insurrection&rdquo; as a &ldquo;COVER UP&rdquo; for fraud.</p> <p>Minnesota is in the midst of uncovering a real fraud problem in its social services. Federal prosecutors have estimated that the total fraud could be as much as $9 billion, although Walz has disputed that number.</p> <p>But the Trump administration has also latched onto <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2026/01/child-care-fraud-minnesota-fact-check/\">misleading</a> claims of fraud in child daycare centers after Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old YouTuber, claimed to find extensive fraud in child care centers in Minnesota. He alleged that they were receiving funds but not providing any services. The state has since sent investigators to do on-site compliance checks at the centers and confirmed that they were all operating normally.</p> <p>Miller&rsquo;s frustration comes in part because the government does have actual problems with fraud. GAO estimated in 2024 that the federal government loses roughly&nbsp;$233 billion to $521 billion every year.&nbsp;</p> <p>The biggest perpetrators of large-scale fraud against the government are organized crime rings and businesses, not individuals getting benefits that misrepresent their eligibility, said Miller.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&#39;s kind of curious how the administration seems not to be paying much, if any attention to organized threats coming from adversarial nations like Russia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But then they also don&#39;t seem too concerned about corruption since they rolled back the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/\">enforcement</a> of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.&rdquo;</p> <p>The claims of daycare fraud in Minnesota aren&rsquo;t the only misleading or false claims of fraud made by the administration.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/us/politics/trump-2020-election-claims-fact-check.html\">continues to pursue</a> claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election that have been repeatedly debunked. This week, FBI agents searched a Georgia election center for ballots and other records from the 2020 election. The Department of Homeland Security has been building a <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/11/dhs-expanding-citizenship-system-voter-verification-despite-concerns-about-potential-disenfranchisement/409512/\">citizenship database</a> to check voter rolls, too &mdash; a move experts say could disenfranchise legitimate voters.</p> <p>Trump officials including Vice President JD Vance claimed last year that 40% of calls to the Social Security Administration were fraudulent.</p> <p>But anti-fraud checks found only <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/05/doge-went-looking-phone-fraud-ssa-and-found-almost-none/405346/?oref=ng-author-river\">2 calls out of over 110,000</a> to potentially be fraudulent after they were installed in response to concerns from the Department of Government Efficiency.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Ultimately, those sorts of inconsistent messages or outright incorrect information undermine the American public&#39;s confidence in the government&#39;s information,&rdquo; said Greenblatt. &ldquo;That&#39;s to our collective detriment.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Fraud still remains a problem</strong></p> <p>The White House disputed those experts&#39; concerns about its anti-fraud efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to continue delivering on this pledge,&rdquo; White House spokesman Davis Ingle told <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> in a statement. &ldquo;In only a year, he has already made significant progress in making the federal government more efficient to better serve the American taxpayer.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the acting vice president of policy and government affairs at the Project on Government Oversight, or POGO, told <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> that he was initially hopeful that DOGE could break things that &ldquo;ought to be broken.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But it turns out, they didn&#39;t really care about efficiency, effectiveness or waste, fraud [and] abuse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were just using the window dressing of that, the rhetorical justification of waste, fraud, abuse, effectiveness, efficiency, to execute a political agenda.&rdquo;</p> <p>Trump has done some helpful things for those in the anti-fraud space, said Miller, namely signing an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/protecting-americas-bank-account-against-fraud-waste-and-abuse/\">executive order</a> to help agencies share data for fraud prevention, which has long been a sore spot for watchdogs.&nbsp;</p> <p>But she added that the Trump administration&rsquo;s work has largely been more hurtful than helpful in terms of fraud, and muddling what fraud is risks turning people off of combatting the actual fraud problems.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&#39;ve been hearing that a lot lately, like &lsquo;They say fraud is a problem. Fraud is not a problem. They&#39;re just using it as a ruse,&rsquo;&rdquo; Miller said. &ldquo;Both things are true &mdash; fraud is a problem, and they&#39;re using it as a ruse.&rdquo;</p> <div class=\"related-articles-placeholder\">[[Related Posts]]</div> <p>Jordan Burris, who worked on technology in the Office of Management and Budget during the Trump and Biden administrations and now works at digital identity company Socure, told <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> that distractions have made it more difficult for those in the anti-fraud space.</p> <p>&ldquo;There have been distractions associated with the politicization of fraud that has made it harder to actually execute on that mission, and further have taken us away from what needs to be done in this moment to combat what we are seeing from nation states and other criminal organizations,&rdquo; he said, advocating instead for using data science at scale to identify payments that shouldn&rsquo;t have been made and installing preventative measures to stop money from going to bad actors in the first place.</p> <p>In early January, the Trump administration froze $10 billion in funding for child care subsidies, social services and cash support for low-income families in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York in the name of fraud prevention, a move that a judge has already blocked with a temporary restraining order. The <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-freezes-child-care-family-assistance-grants-five-states-fraud-concerns.html\">press release</a> announcing the freeze did not cite any specific instances of ongoing fraud in those states, beyond &ldquo;identified concerns.&rdquo;</p> <p>Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_rfk_and_alex_adams_re_acf_funding_freeze.pdf\">called the administration&#39;s</a> withholding of funds retaliation. Hedtler-Gaudette said that the administration is weaponizing fraud by going after it selectively. The freeze is the latest example of the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/14/us/trump-grants-democrat-districts-government-shutdown.html\">withholding funding</a> from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/us/politics/trump-fema-funds-immigration.html\">Democratic-run</a> parts of the country.</p> <p>&ldquo;A huge number of people are being denied supports they are legally entitled to,&rdquo; said Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. &ldquo;Fraud has consistently been an excuse to go after safety net programs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>Previous administrations may also have politicized fraud issues &mdash; think of the &ldquo;welfare queen&rdquo; narrative &mdash; said Miller, adding that what&rsquo;s happening now is different in magnitude and scope.</p> <p>She previously ran a consulting group to help the government implement a fraud risk management framework developed by GAO. That work has stopped, though, and the company doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, after they lost their government contracts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;All the work we were doing in the fraud space &mdash; we&rsquo;re not doing it anymore,&rdquo; said Miller. &ldquo;And in many cases, the clients that we were working with, are also no longer doing any fraud risk management work.&rdquo;</p>",

In September, however, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/09/trump-budget-office-hiding-federal-spending-information-ethics-nonprofit-alleges/408317/\">alleged in a filing that OMB was not complying with the order</a> by including footnotes that specified the apportionments were subject to nonpublic spend plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The organization reported that at least 131 of the 2,245 apportionment documents approved between March 24 and Sept. 5 included undisclosed spend plans.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Wednesday, Sullivan sided with CREW.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;OMB has incorporated-by-reference the terms of certain spend plans in legally binding footnotes. Since the terms of such spend plans contain legally binding limits on the agencies&rsquo; ability to obligate funds, the spend plans are &lsquo;documents apportioning an appropriation,&rsquo; and must be made publicly available under [current law] and this court&rsquo;s July 21, 2025, order,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp;</p> <p>CREW celebrated the ruling in a Thursday fundraising email.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Vought and OMB leadership went out of their way to make it look like they were following the court&#39;s order to reveal spending decisions, while burying the real information the public needed in secretive spend plans,&rdquo; said Donald Sherman, the organization&rsquo;s president. &ldquo;We will watch closely to make sure this order is followed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>Rep.

Since the start of Trump&rsquo;s second term, the Government Accountability Office, which reviews the legality of impoundments, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/impoundment-control-act#RecentDecisions\">has issued</a> five decisions with violations, four without violations and two with mixed outcomes.</p>",

Steven Lepper, a retired Air Force judge advocate general, said he has serious doubts about the administration&#39;s new use of the military lawyers.</p> <p>&ldquo;That proposal is inconsistent with the typical way in which military lawyers have been used as special assistant U.S. attorneys in the past,&rdquo; Lepper said. &ldquo;The fact that there is no military nexus here between the kinds of cases that JAGs serving as special assistant U.S. attorneys are going to help prosecute essentially puts these JAGs in a role where the fundamental question ought to be whether doing that is a violation of Posse Comitatus.&rdquo;</p> <p>Lepper added that these lawyers are still subject to the UCMJ, making it harder for them to challenge certain actions. After the deaths of U.S. citizens in Minneapolis during immigration-related law enforcement operations, several federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/14/nx-s1-5676293/several-federal-prosecutors-in-minnesota-resign-over-ice-shooting-investigation\">resigned</a> from their roles.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;It takes military lawyers who are less likely to say no, or for whom it becomes more difficult to say no, and puts them in a position where they essentially are being asked to follow orders that others wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lepper said.</p> <p>The moves are a burden on the judge advocate general corps, which is already overworked.</p> <p>Eric Carpenter, a retired Army lawyer who is now an associate professor of law at Florida International University, said &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no fat to cut&rdquo; in the JAG corps. He added that given how understaffed many JAG offices are, it&rsquo;s unlikely that special assistant U.S. attorneys who&rsquo;ve been working on cases tied to military bases would be reassigned to the new roles.</p> <p>Carpenter also said those who get sent to U.S. cities for those roles are likely to face a steep learning curve.</p> <p>&ldquo;I think most of the people getting [mobilized] or tasked for this aren&#39;t going to have any federal prosecution experience,&rdquo; Carpenter said. &ldquo;So they&#39;re going to be just jumping in and trying to figure it out as they go.&rdquo;</p>",

    "description": "Annual adjustments to retirement benefits, FEHB costs, Social Security rules and TSP limits are now taking effect.",
    "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s a new year, and there are new benefit amounts that take effect at the beginning of each year as well as basic pay adjustments for federal workers under the General Schedule and cost of living adjustments for retirees. There are many federal employees who have retired since Sept. 30, who have not had their retirement claims finalized, and they have been wondering about what changes they need to be aware of in the new year. For most feds, there are changes in the premiums paid for Federal Employees Health Benefits. For retirees who are working after retirement, there are also new earnings limits applied to their FERS Special Retirement Supplement and Social Security benefits.</p> <p>Here is a summary of changes that are or will be taking place this year:</p> <p><strong>Pay and Retirement Benefit Adjustments</strong></p> <p>Federal employees technically do not receive cost-of-living adjustments, but instead they receive congressionally approved and often politically motivated annual pay adjustments. According to the Office of Personnel Management, the GS base pay schedule is usually adjusted annually each January with an across-the-board pay increase based on nationwide changes in the cost of wages and salaries of private industry workers. Most GS employees are also entitled to locality pay, which is a geographic-based percentage rate that reflects pay levels for nonfederal workers in certain geographic areas as determined by surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p> <p>In a memo dated Dec. 18, 2025, from Scott Kupor, OPM director, it was announced that the president has signed an executive order to implement the January 2026 pay adjustments. Pursuant to the president&rsquo;s alternative plan issued under 5 U.S.C. 5303(b) and 5304a on Aug. 28, 2025, the executive order authorizes a 1.0% across-the-board increase for statutory pay systems and provides that locality percentages will remain at 2025 levels. OPM has most of the 2026 pay charts available on its website. If you were an employee on the first day of the new leave year (Jan. 11, 2026, for most federal employees), your salary rate would have reflected the increase starting on this date.</p> <p><strong>Lump Sum Annual Leave Payment</strong></p> <p>If you retired earlier than Jan. 11, 2026, you may have had some of your lump sum annual leave payment paid at the new salary rate. Generally, a lump-sum payment for annual leave will equal the pay the employee would have received had they remained employed until the expiration of the period covered by the annual leave. The additional portion reflecting the 2026 pay increase may come at a later date than your initial lump sum leave payout. A lump sum payment is paid for unused annual leave only and cannot be paid for other types of leave, such as sick leave, military leave or home leave. Read more about the lump sum payment for unused annual leave on a fact sheet available at <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/lump-sum-payments-for-annual-leave/\">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/lump-sum-payments-for-annual-leave/</a></p> <p>Here are some things OPM wants you to know about this payment:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Payment may take several months due to agency processing and leave account audits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Employees who separate from federal service should keep a copy of their final leave and earnings statement (LES) showing their leave balances and request a copy of their SF-1150, Record of Leave Data upon Separation or Transfer, for their records.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contact your former agency&rsquo;s human resources office with any questions about your lump-sum payment.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you return to federal service before the end of your lump-sum leave period, expect to repay part of the payment and have those hours recredited to your leave balance.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Retirement Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA)</strong></p> <p>On the other hand, annuitants (this includes retired federal employees and entitled surviving family members of deceased federal employees and retirees) received a cost-of-living adjustment effective on Dec. 1, 2025, which should have been reflected in their benefit payable on Jan. 2, 2026. If you retired on Dec. 31, 2025, with your first annuity payment due on Feb. 1 (for the month of January 2026), you will need to wait until next January as your first COLA will be paid on Jan. 4, 2027 (the first business day in January 2027).</p> <p>Annuitants who retired earlier in 2025 will receive a prorated COLA during their first year on the annuity rolls. The proration is based on the number of months between the start date of the annuity and the effective date of the COLA. For example, if a CSRS employee had retired on Dec. 31, 2024, they would have received 11/12 of the 2.8% COLA that was effective on Dec. 1, 2025, or a 2.56% increase, on Jan. 2, 2026.</p> <p>FERS cost-of-living adjustments are not provided until age 62, except for disability, survivor benefits and other &ldquo;special provision&rdquo; retirements (i.e., law enforcement, firefighters, etc.). FERS disability retirees get the adjustment, except when they are receiving a disability annuity based on 60% of their high-3 average salary during the first 12 months of receiving disability retirement. Also, under FERS, if retirees have a CSRS component, the component is subject to the CSRS COLA calculation. FERS survivors receive the FERS increase on their entire annuity, even where there may be a CSRS component. A FERS employee who was eligible for a COLA immediately upon retirement would also receive a prorated COLA as described in the previous paragraph.</p> <p>COLA increases for FERS annuitants eligible before age 62 only apply to the retiree&rsquo;s basic annuity (not the annuity supplement). For spousal survivor annuitants, the COLA applies to both the basic survivor annuity and the FERS annuity supplement (payable to survivors of retirees who are under age 60). The FERS COLA payable beginning with the December 2025 annuity payment is only 2.0% due to the FERS rules that provide a &ldquo;diet&rdquo; COLA. If the rate of inflation is between 2% and 3%, FERS retirement benefits only receive a 2% increase.</p> <p>To get the full COLA, a retiree&rsquo;s annuity or a survivor&rsquo;s annuity must have begun no later than Dec. 31, 2024. If not, the increase is prorated under both CSRS and FERS retirement plans. Prorated accounts receive one-twelfth of the increase each month they receive benefits. For example, if the benefit commenced between Nov. 1 and Nov. 30, 2025, the prorated COLA would be one-twelfth of the full COLA.</p> <p><strong>Social Security COLA</strong></p> <p>The 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will begin with benefits payable to nearly 71 million Social Security beneficiaries in January 2026.</p> <p><strong>FERS Special Retirement Supplement (SRS) Earnings Limit</strong></p> <p>FERS retirees receiving an annuity supplement are subject to an earnings test. In the spring, around May, OPM sends an annual survey to annuitants who receive the SRS, so they can report their earnings from the previous year. The annuity supplement will be reduced effective with the July 2026 FERS annuity payment (payable on Aug. 1) if the earnings were more than the limit established for the prior year by the Social Security Administration. The reduction is $1 for every $2 earned over the minimum level.</p> <p><strong>Social Security Earnings Limit</strong></p> <p>Work earnings before the full retirement age (FRA) (67 if you were born in 1960 or later) can affect your Social Security benefit payment. If you said you&rsquo;d keep working when you applied, Social Security will send you a form each year to estimate your earnings. If you&rsquo;re younger than your FRA during all of 2026, Social Security must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $24,480 (2026 earnings limit). If you reach full retirement age in 2026, they will deduct $1 from your benefits for every $3 you earn above $65,160 until the month you reach full retirement age. If you will have earnings over the limit, notify Social Security immediately to avoid a large overpayment of your Social Security benefits. If you receive too much in benefits, Social Security will send you information regarding the options for repaying the amount owed.</p> <p><strong>Maximum Taxable Wage for Social Security Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI; aka FICA)</strong></p> <p>The OASDI tax rate for wages paid in 2026 is set by statute at 6.2% for employees and employers, each. If you earn wages equal to or larger than $184,500, then you would contribute $11,439.00 to the OASDI program in 2026, and your employer would contribute the same amount. The OASDI tax rate for self-employment income in 2026 is 12.4%.</p> <p><strong>Medicare</strong></p> <p>If you plan to enroll in Medicare Part B and you missed your Initial Enrollment Period at age 65, there is a General Enrollment Period every year between Jan. 1 and March 31. Part B coverage will start the month after you sign up. You might have to pay a permanent late enrollment penalty if you don&rsquo;t qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. Medicare premium for Part B is increased 10% for each full 12 months during which you could have been, but was not, enrolled.</p> <p>The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will be $202.90 for 2026, an increase of $17.90 from 2025. You&rsquo;ll pay a higher premium for Part B if your modified adjusted gross income, as reported on your IRS tax return from 2024, was more than $106,000 if you file an individual tax return or more than $212,000 if you are married and file a joint tax return. Most people pay the standard rate; however, the Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) is an extra charge added to the premium for higher earners.</p> <p><strong>Federal Employees Health Benefits</strong></p> <p>The new rates for your FEHB plan take effect on Jan. 11, 2026, for most federal employees. However, the rates for retirees and Postal employees took effect on Jan. 1 and will be adjusted in the CSRS or FERS benefit that you receive on Feb. 1 (which is your January annuity payment).</p> <p><strong>Thrift Savings Plan</strong></p> <p>Roth in-plan conversions are now available in My Account &mdash; Beginning this month, a Roth in-plan conversion option is available in My Account. Roth in-plan conversions allow you to convert money from your traditional (pre-tax) balance to a Roth (after-tax) balance within your TSP account. If you don&rsquo;t already have a Roth TSP balance, your first conversion will automatically create one.</p> <p>Before you decide to do a Roth in-plan conversion, it&rsquo;s important to consider the current and future effects on your taxes. When you convert pre-tax money to Roth, the conversion amount becomes part of your taxable income for the year, which could increase your tax rate. You&rsquo;ll need to pay taxes on the conversion amount using personal funds from another source, such as a savings account. You cannot use part of the amount you&rsquo;re converting to pay taxes. It is strongly recommended that you consult a tax advisor before making a Roth in-plan conversion as this action can have a significant impact on your taxes. Once you do a conversion, you cannot reverse it or change it. A tax advisor can help you decide if a conversion makes sense for your situation.</p> <p>The annual elective deferral limit (i.e., limit on employee contributions) for 2026 is $24,500, and the catch-up contribution limit for employees turning 50 in 2026 or older increased by $500 to $8,000. If you turn 60, 61, 62 or 63, in 2026, the IRS gives you an even higher catch-up limit of $11,250. In the year you turn 64, the limit returns to the regular catch-up amount. These limits apply to your contributions and do not include matching or automatic government contributions. If you&rsquo;re turning 50 or older and exceed the IRS elective deferral limit, then your contributions will automatically start counting toward the IRS catch-up limit. If you earned more than the IRS income threshold ($150,000 in 2026, unchanged from 2025, adjusted annually for inflation) and your total contributions exceed the elective deferral limit, those additional contributions &mdash; catch-up contributions &mdash; must be Roth.</p> <p>In mid-January, the TSP will mail IRS Form 1099-R, Distributions from Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc., to participants who received a withdrawal between Jan. 1 and Dec. 27, 2025, and/or a taxed or foreclosed loan between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 202. Withdrawals processed after noon on Dec. 29 are taxable income for 2026. A copy of your 2025 Form 1099-R will also be available in your My Account secure participant mailbox by mid-February. If needed, corrected forms will be issued within three weeks of verifying the correction. It is a good idea to consult a qualified tax advisor or the IRS for questions about filing your taxes.</p> <p>TSP life expectancy installments will be recalculated according to required updates to the assumptions used to determine those amounts. In early January, the TSP will send notices with more information, including recalculated amounts, to participants receiving life expectancy installments. Notices will go out based on participants&rsquo; delivery preferences on file (by mail or online through the secure participant mailbox in My Account).</p> <p>In early January, the TSP will send RMD calculation notices to separated participants who will be 73 and older in 2026 and to spousal beneficiaries with RMDs due for the 2026 calendar year. Notices will go out based on participants&rsquo; delivery preferences on file (by mail or online through the secure participant mailbox in My Account). If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, the TSP encourages you to add direct deposit information in My Account to receive your money quickly and easily.</p> <div class=\"related-articles-placeholder\">[[Related Posts]]</div> <p></p>",

    "description": "Senate Democrats and the White House reached an agreement late Thursday to fund most departments and agencies through Sept. 30 after a previous funding bill was blocked.",
    "content": "<p><em>Updated at 9:18 p.m.</em></p> <p>Senate Democrats and&nbsp;the White House came to an agreement late Thursday to fund the vast majority of federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year, and a two-week stopgap measure to fund the Homeland Security Department while continued negotiations take place over reforms at DHS.<br /> <br /> Senate leaders worked into the evening to schedule a vote. It is unclear when the House, which is in recess until Monday, will vote on the measure.</p> <p>&ldquo;Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan &ldquo;YES&rdquo; Vote,&rdquo; President Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p> <p>The deal came hours after eight Republicans joined all Democrats in defeating a previous measure, which the House had approved with broad bipartisan support. It was set to coast to President Trump&rsquo;s desk until Border Patrol agents fatally shot Alex Pretti on Jan. 24, leading to demands from Senate Democrats that more restrictions be placed on the Homeland Security Department&rsquo;s immigration enforcement efforts as part of the agency&rsquo;s funding bill.&nbsp;</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., subsequently laid out his caucus&rsquo; demands for DHS reforms, including the removal of masks by DHS law enforcement personnel, mandated use of body cameras, a requirement for third-party warrants to enter homes, the end of roving patrols in metropolitan areas by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and more uniform restrictions on use of force by federal agents. Democrats engaged the White House on those requests and ultimately negotiated a bipartisan path forward.</p> <p>Lawmakers in both parties had expressed an openness to carving out DHS appropriations and passing the other five spending bills still outstanding. The package funds the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies. Under the plan, Congress would approve a stopgap continuing resolution for DHS to allow for negotiations to continue for two weeks.&nbsp;</p> <p>The&nbsp;failed bill would have almost certainly led&nbsp;to at least a short shutdown, however, as funding those agencies was set to expire first thing Saturday.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a deal getting signed into law imminent, the Office of Management and Budget could instruct agencies to delay shutdown procedures. OMB <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2018/02/government-funding-expires-white-house-expects-short-technical-lapse/145858/\">pursued such an approach</a> in 2018 when funding briefly expired for agencies but it declared the impasse was merely a &ldquo;short, technical lapse.&rdquo; It advised employees to show up to work due to the imminence of a resolution, though the situation <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/2018/02/short-lived-shutdown-sparks-confusion-across-federal-agencies/145872/\">created widespread confusion</a> across federal agencies.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "At the White House\u2019s request, the federal government\u2019s dedicated HR agency has updated its proposal limiting how many employees agencies can rate as above average to narrow the methods by which federal workers can challenge a perceived unfair rating.",
    "content": "<p>Federal agencies almost unanimously warned the Office of Personnel Management that its forthcoming regulatory proposal overhauling federal performance management and instituting limits on how many employees can be rated above average will worsen mission delivery and open agencies up to litigation.</p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/12/trump-limit-top-ratings-all-feds-and-consolidate-scoring-forthcoming-rule/410246/\"> draft notice of proposed rulemaking</a>, which would propose removing the prohibition on the &ldquo;forced distribution&rdquo; of performance ratings, removing the level two or &ldquo;minimally satisfactory&rdquo; rating from the five-level structure currently used by many federal agencies, and greenlighting supervisors to grant level one&mdash;or &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; performance&mdash;without the higher-level review that is currently required, was promulgated to agencies for review and feedback last month.</p> <p>But in comments on the proposal, reviewed by <em>Government Executive</em>, most agencies sought to push back against OPM&rsquo;s plan, warning that enforcing a forced distribution of performance ratings contradicts merit systems principles and reduces collaboration and cohesion among employees.</p> <p>&ldquo;While we endorse the proposal&rsquo;s focus on a supervisory critical element, omitting level 2 on performance and biennial certification as effective tools, we strongly recommend retaining the prohibition on forced distribution,&rdquo; wrote the Defense Department. &ldquo;This practice is fundamentally at odds with the Merit Systems Principles, which require that performance be assessed against an individual&rsquo;s own success in meeting objective criteria, not their standing relative to others in a mandated quota . . . Decades of management research, and the subsequent reversal of this policy by many private sector organizations, confirm that forced ranking systems degrade organizational effectiveness.&rdquo;</p> <p>At least the departments of Defense, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, Energy, Labor and Health and Human Services, as well as NASA and the General Services Administration provided comments criticizing the rule in whole or in part. Of the comments reviewed by <em>Government Executive</em>, only the Social Security Administration actually expressed support for forced distributions, though it too expressed concerns about other aspects of the proposed rule.</p> <p>The White House, conversely, proposed appending a new provision to the internal draft: a ban on employees filing union grievances over a perceived unfair performance rating. OPM adopted the recommendation.</p> <p>&ldquo;[Trump&rsquo;s 2018 executive order targeting unions and poor performers] generally prohibited union grievances over performance ratings,&rdquo; the Executive Office of the President wrote. &ldquo;We think that is good policy and would like to return to that. Request adding in a prohibition on unions grieving performance ratings in this rule.&rdquo;</p> <p>OPM told agencies that it plans to institute the new rating system in time for the fiscal 2026 performance review season, though employees at a smattering of agencies have reported their agencies have already quietly instituted forced distributions, despite the standing ban.</p> <p>Several agencies warned that applying a forced distribution of ratings on a workforce could come into conflict with federal regulations and merit system principles that state that performance ratings be based on objective criteria, as spelled out in employees&rsquo; performance plans. They cautioned that the new system would require managers to award &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; ratings distinctions between similarly performing employees, which would lead to less trust in the system.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The forced distribution system without any flexibility to account for actual performance may prohibit supervisors from assigning an accurate rating,&rdquo; wrote NASA. &ldquo;A forced distribution system by definition and as described here, could align individual performance to a predetermined distribution outcome (e.g., a fixed percentage of employees must fall into each rating category). As a result: employees may receive ratings unrelated to their actual performance; individual performance may receive different ratings depending on distribution constraints; and objective, job-related criteria become secondary to statistical targets.&rdquo;</p> <p>Other agencies cautioned the changes could unfairly punish highly performing offices.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;With the intent to drive high performance, this could have unintended negative consequences if applied to small high-performing teams where there truly are no bottom-level performers,&rdquo; said the Treasury Department. &ldquo;Alternatively, would a team of mediocre performers still have a segment of top ratings due to forced distribution? Forced distribution has the potential to lead to inconsistent ratings across the workforce if employees are rated against a &lsquo;curve&rsquo; instead of an established performance standard.&rdquo;</p> <p>In response, OPM noted the creation last year of a new performance management officer role within federal agencies, who will be responsible with handling those questions.</p> <p>&ldquo;As part of that role, the agency PMO should develop, through agency policy, how the forced distribution of the GS population will be applied and validated,&rdquo; OPM wrote. &ldquo;Prior to the end of [fiscal] 2026, OPM will issue guidance on how the role of the PMO should be used with respect to the forced distribution of ratings.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, meanwhile, said the rule would discourage collaboration. Forced distribution risks &ldquo;turning colleagues into competitors,&rdquo; EEOC said, and disincentives mentoring and solving problems collectively. OPM countered that managers should remind employees they will be evaluated only on their own, individual work.</p> <p>The White House suggested that OPM had a branding problem. The agency should use the term &ldquo;curve&rdquo; or &ldquo;stacked ranking&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;forced distribution,&rdquo; EOP said, which it described as &ldquo;hostile sounding&rdquo; and &ldquo;not great framing/messaging.&rdquo; OPM rejected the suggestion, saying its terminology is more accurate even if more hostile.&nbsp;</p> <p>White House officials also recommended that OPM elaborate on its reasoning for overturning the forced distribution ban, which has been on the books for more than 30 years, in an apparent nod toward the Administrative Procedure Act&rsquo;s requirement that agencies give reasonable explanations for their regulatory actions.</p> <p>&ldquo;Think the rule needs to do more to explain why it is removing the prohibition on a forced distribution, given that this is a change in position from the Clinton administration rulemaking,&rdquo; the Executive Office of the President wrote. OPM disagreed.</p> <p>&ldquo;OPM has provided significant explanations on the benefits of forced distribution through its rulemaking with the [Senior Executive Service] and [senior professional] populations, as well as its recent guidance on normalizing ratings,&rdquo; the agency wrote. &ldquo;Additionally, although this is a change in position, OPM has provided the recent ratings data which illustrates how ratings have skewed far beyond a normalization of a majority of fully successful ratings.&rdquo;</p> <div class=\"related-articles-placeholder\">[[Related Posts]]</div> <p></p>",

The White House urges congressional Democrats not to subject the country to another debilitating government shutdown.&rdquo;</p> <p>Schumer said during his press conference the White House &ldquo;has had no specific, good, concrete ideas.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Alex Pretti killing</strong></p> <p>Congress has approved half of a dozen full-year government funding bills but hasn&rsquo;t yet cleared the remaining measures, which make up a huge swath of government spending.</p> <p>A partial government shutdown would affect the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury. The Executive Office of the President, Supreme Court and judicial branch would also go without funding.</p> <p>Democrats&rsquo; insistence for additional guardrails on how federal immigration officers operate follows the death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, the second person in Minneapolis shot and killed by federal immigration agents.</p> <p>ICE would still be able to operate during a shutdown due to an influx of funding from the massive tax and spending cuts package Republicans passed and President Donald Trump signed into law last summer.</p> <p>The &ldquo;One Big Beautiful Act&rdquo; provided the Department of Homeland Security with $170 billion for immigration enforcement spread across four years, with $75 billion of that going directly to ICE.</p> <p>The Homeland Security appropriations bill at the center of the current dispute in Congress keeps ICE flat funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 and will end on Sept. 30.</p> <p>In the wake of the Jan. 7 shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross, Democrats and Republicans agreed to some changes for the department that are provided for in the bill. That includes $20 million for body cameras for ICE and other federal immigration officers, $20 million for independent oversight of detention facilities, and a $1 billion cut to Customs and Border Protection funding, which totals $18.3 billion.</p> <p>Border Patrol agents&rsquo; shooting of Pretti on Jan. 24 spurred Democrats to call for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign and demand additional reforms at DHS.</p> <p><strong>No masks, body cameras required</strong></p> <p>Maine independent Sen. Angus King said Wednesday while the funding bill up for debate allocates money for optional body cameras, he wants to require immigration agents to wear them and to identify themselves.</p> <p>&ldquo;I think one of the things that should be in it is no masks,&rdquo; King said. &ldquo;There&#39;s not a law enforcement agency in the United States that wears masks. I&#39;ve never encountered that before in my life.&rdquo;</p> <p>King added he wants to see increased &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; for federal immigration officers, including &ldquo;independent investigations of injuries to either detainees or private citizens.&rdquo;</p> <p>The top Democrat on the panel that deals with Homeland Security funding, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said the proposed changes are a start.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a much longer list of reforms that I would like, but we&rsquo;re operating in a world of possibility, and I think that these reforms are things that we could get done in the next couple days, or the next week,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she&rsquo;s okay splitting off the Homeland Security spending bill from the rest of the package.</p> <p>Murkowski also said she believes Trump should replace Noem.</p> <p>&ldquo;Ultimately it&#39;s his call as to who he keeps in this position, whether it&#39;s Secretary Noem or someone else. I understand that. And he&#39;ll decide,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just think that he deserves better.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Two &lsquo;losers,&rsquo; Trump says</strong></p> <p>North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis also called for Noem&rsquo;s resignation, and for White House senior advisor Stephen Miller to be removed. Miller is the main architect of the Trump administration&rsquo;s immigration policy and played a pivotal role in the president&#39;s first administration.</p> <p>On Tuesday during an interview with ABC News, Trump called Tillis and Murkowski &ldquo;both losers&rdquo; for calling for Noem&rsquo;s resignation and criticizing her handling of immigration operations in Minnesota. The president has stood by Noem.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&#39;m kind of excited about being called a loser,&rdquo; Tillis said. &ldquo;Apparently, that qualifies me for DHS secretary and senior advisor to the president.&rdquo;</p> <p>South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds didn&rsquo;t entirely rule out supporting a five-bill funding package if GOP leaders agree to remove the DHS appropriations bill.</p> <p>&quot;I won&#39;t get ahead of the president on it ... but even if you do that, the House still has to approve that,&rdquo; Rounds said. &ldquo;The question is, logistically, can they get back in time to do it by Friday night?&quot;</p> <p>Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, ranking member on the House Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, wrote in a social media post that while the current bill isn&rsquo;t perfect, it &ldquo;is better than those alternatives.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But the worst thing Congress could do is allow a powerful department to operate with a blank check under a continuing resolution or shut the government down entirely.&rdquo;</p> <div class=\"related-articles-placeholder\">[[Related Posts]]</div> <p></p>",

    "description": "The new restrictions on hiring reflect the needs in the field, VA leaders tell lawmakers.",
    "content": "<p>The Veterans Affairs Department is looking to streamline its structure and cut positions in its workforce to reduce layers of bureaucracy and better align staffing to the needs of the department, agency officials told lawmakers on Wednesday, who said the changes would improve services to veterans.&nbsp;</p> <p>VA Secretary Doug Collins defended the major shakeups to the organization of VA health care, suggesting the reforms were driven by employees in the field and veteran demands. Some members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, which hosted Wednesday&rsquo;s hearing, expressed skepticism of Collins&rsquo; plan to slash the number of regional offices&mdash;known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks, or VISNs&mdash;from 18 to 5, suggesting it would centralize decision making away from the field in favor of the department&rsquo;s headquarters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Collins and other VA officials said its current construct contains too many layers and it is therefore overly cumbersome to distribute and align department policies. Regional offices will maintain leaders who handle engagements with community stakeholders, medical centers, medical leadership and veterans and their families, while VISN directors will handle policy and funding issues.&nbsp;</p> <p>The secretary similarly said staffing had ballooned out of control in recent years, which itself has led to the department becoming too unwieldy to manage. New <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/09/va-set-caps-its-workforce-eliminate-positions-and-tighten-controls-hiring/407877/\">staffing caps</a> were developed in consultation with each medical center director, VA officials said, and adjusted to meet their requests.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;When you get an internal growth and you have an important department so large that they can&#39;t basically move because of internal frameworks,&rdquo; Collins said, &ldquo;this is where we get the problems.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>He added that &ldquo;throwing employees&rdquo; at VA&rsquo;s problems creates &ldquo;more bureaucracy, more overhead&rdquo; that leads to &ldquo;slowing down and actually removes folks from actually supporting our veterans.&rdquo;</p> <p>Greg Goins, the Veterans Health Administration&rsquo;s acting chief operating officer, said Congress and VA anticipated the passage of the 2022 PACT Act&mdash;which made millions of veterans exposed to toxic burn pits newly eligible for department care&mdash;would lead to soaring new demands on the department and it hired commensurately. That surge never materialized as expected, Goins said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Our organization cannot withstand over time and be sustained with a 14% increase of personnel to support a 6% increase in workload of that same period, it&#39;s unsustainable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&#39;s not right for taxpayers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said front-line health care workers should not be thought of as unnecessary bureaucracy. VA employees have for years suggested many department facilities are severely understaffed and staff are overworked.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The doctors and nurses aren&#39;t overhead,&rdquo; she said, adding VA was risking &ldquo;arbitrary caps&rdquo; that restricted VA&rsquo;s capacity.&nbsp;</p> <p>The issue raised some bipartisan concerns. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., who chairs the Senate VA committee, said after the hearing he was hopeful VA would allow the caps to be adjusted as needed.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;If there&#39;s a problem with it that develops, we would not want a cap to be the determining factor,&rdquo; Moran said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Collins stressed there would be no layoffs associated with the reorganization and other officials noted the department was removing vacant billets that were often created with congressional funding to back them up. VA shed around 30,000 employees in 2025 after walking back a plan to slash more than 80,000 through layoffs and attrition.&nbsp;</p> <p>VA also announced on Wednesday it was investing a record $5 billion on health care infrastructure, including improving medical facilities, building upgrades and electronic health record modernization.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several Democratic senators criticized Collins for stating over the weekend regarding his former employee, Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by Border Patrol agents on Saturday. The secretary expressed his condolences to Pretti&rsquo;s family and colleagues, but said he stood by <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2026/01/violent-death-one-our-own-va-employees-ask-more-their-agency-after-nurse-fatally-shot/410948/?oref=ge-topic-lander-featured-river\">his statement</a> that he died because of the policies of local officials in Minnesota.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the hearing was wrapping up, federal employees held a vigil outside VA&rsquo;s headquarters to honor Pretti&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;He wanted to make a difference,&rdquo; said Sen. Richard Blumental, D-Conn., the committee&rsquo;s top Democrat. &ldquo;He did, as evidenced by the countless co-workers, veterans and families who have come forward with stories about his compassion and his positive impact on their lives. Alex loved his job.&rdquo;</p>",

    "description": "COMMENTARY | A VA employee writes about staffing cuts, labor changes and their impact on morale and care.",
    "content": "<p>For nearly 30 years, I have worked inside the Department of Veterans Affairs adjudicating disability claims for veterans and their families. For more than 13 of those years, I have also served as an employee advocate with the American Federation of Government Employees at VA Central Office.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those roles have given me a rare vantage point into the VA&rsquo;s culture, priorities and values. I have worked under secretaries appointed by both Democrats and Republicans, alongside employees across disciplines and job series. One thing has always been constant: VA employees are deeply committed to serving our nation&rsquo;s veterans. Today, that commitment is being tested, and increasingly undermined, by the leadership of VA Secretary Doug Collins.</p> <p>The killing of VA nurse Alex Pretti, and Secretary Collins&rsquo; public response to it, brought that strain into sharp focus. Pretti was a federal employee, a VA nurse and a member of AFGE Local 3669 who spent his career caring for veterans in moments of crisis. He was killed after coming to the aid of a woman who had been shoved to the ground by a federal agent. Video and eyewitness accounts show that he was pepper-sprayed, forced to the ground, beaten while restrained and then shot multiple times by federal agents. For VA employees across the country, this was not an abstract news event. It was the violent loss of one of our own.</p> <p>Employees told me they expected VA leadership to pause, reflect and center the life that was lost and the community that was grieving, including the VA community in Minneapolis. Secretary Collins acknowledged that Pretti was a VA employee, but his public statement quickly pivoted to political commentary, blaming state and local officials for failing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and framing the killing as part of broader &ldquo;chaos and death&rdquo; in American cities. Employees across headquarters described that shift as jarring and dispiriting. To them, it reinforced a growing sense that even tragedy is filtered through ideology rather than met with institutional care, restraint, and humanity.</p> <p>For many employees, Secretary Collins&rsquo; response was not surprising. Since arriving at VA, his policy decisions have steadily undermined trust and stability. VA employees have faced workforce reductions, the rollback of telework, the loss of reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities and the elimination of collective bargaining rights for large portions of the workforce. Many have come to view these decisions as punitive in effect and disconnected from any clear effort to improve care or service to veterans.</p> <p>That erosion of trust deepened when Secretary Collins publicly announced plans to eliminate approximately 83,000 VA positions, roughly 15% of the department&rsquo;s workforce, without presenting a workforce analysis or explaining how such reductions would affect veteran care. At the time, he assured Congress and the veteran community that frontline health care workers would not be included. That assurance collapsed when an internal VA document surfaced outlining potential cuts to thousands of frontline clinical positions.</p> <p>When Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., confronted Secretary Collins about the document during a House Veterans&rsquo; Affairs Committee hearing, Collins did not deny its authenticity or address the contradiction. Instead, he dismissed it as &ldquo;pre-decisional&rdquo; and objected to its disclosure. Employees expressed deep concern that reductions to frontline health care workers were being actively considered while the secretary publicly promised the opposite. The disconnect between public assurances and internal planning led many employees to question whether leadership statements had any credibility at all.</p> <p>Those concerns are not theoretical. Independent reporting has cited findings from congressional investigators showing that VA staffing losses, overwhelmingly within the Veterans Health Administration, are already contributing to longer wait times, delayed care and mounting pressure on remaining clinicians. In that context, claims that workforce reductions will not affect veteran care ring hollow. Employees see one reality inside the department and hear another described publicly. Veterans ultimately pay the price.</p> <p>Few actions have angered VA employees more than the decision to terminate collective bargaining rights for large portions of the workforce by reclassifying employees as &ldquo;national security&rdquo; personnel. Employees have been unequivocal with me: they view this not as a legitimate security determination, but as a pretext to weaken a union that has been effective in holding leadership accountable.</p> <p>The justification strains credulity for many employees. Nurses, claims examiners, schedulers, canteen workers and Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals attorneys were suddenly deemed &ldquo;national security&rdquo; employees under a narrow provision of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. That statute permits suspension of bargaining only where an employee&rsquo;s primary duties involve national security work, something most people associate with the FBI or CIA, not a canteen barista making a morning latte. Many employees view this reclassification as a political maneuver to silence dissent while worker protections are stripped away.</p> <p>The consequences were immediate. With bargaining suspended, management gained unilateral authority to change working conditions without employee input. At the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals, higher production quotas were imposed without employee input, coinciding with increased attrition and growing concerns about declining decision quality and rising remand rates. Across VA Central Office, employees reported abrupt revocations of long-standing reasonable accommodations, particularly related to telework. Many told me they now feel exposed and unprotected when working conditions change overnight.</p> <p>This matters for veterans. Collective bargaining has never been about shielding poor performance. It is how employees across the VA raise concerns that directly affect patient safety, access to care and the timely delivery of benefits. While most VA nurses and clinicians work in medical centers, the systems that support them &ndash; IT platforms, supply chains, benefits processing, national policies and program oversight &ndash; are coordinated from headquarters. When employees can speak up about unsafe workloads, staffing gaps or broken systems without fear of retaliation, problems can be addressed before they delay care or harm veterans. When that voice is silenced, accountability erodes, risks go unaddressed and veterans pay the price.</p> <p>At the same time, employees received agency-wide communications focused on cultural and symbolic issues, such as alleged anti-Christian bias and the removal of flags, that felt divorced from the day-to-day work of serving veterans. In more than 13 years as an employee advocate, I personally have never seen a complaint involving anti-Christian bias, and if one had arisen, existing law already provides clear protections under Title VII. Employees were left wondering what problem these messages were meant to solve.</p> <p>Employees understand this instinctively. When trust and integrity break down, veterans are the ones who suffer. A workforce that does not trust its leadership cannot sustain morale, retain experience or deliver high-quality care. Former VA Secretary and Procter &amp; Gamble CEO Bob McDonald understood this well, emphasizing that culture and trust are the foundations of institutional performance.</p> <p>Taken together, the response to tragedy, arbitrary workforce reductions, the elimination of collective bargaining, rigid performance mandates and inconsistent candor form a pattern. Each decision strains trust. Together, they hollow it out.</p> <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs does not need disruption for its own sake. It needs leadership that respects the law, engages honestly with Congress and understands that caring for veterans requires sustaining the workforce that serves them. Without trust, no amount of authority can substitute for leadership, and veterans ultimately bear the cost.</p> <p><em>Douglas Massey is the president of AFGE Local 17 and an attorney advisor at the Board of Veterans&#39; Appeals.</em></p>",

CORE employees are often the first to deploy following a disaster and, according to the lawsuit, some of the terminated workers were in the middle of hurricane relief deployments.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Government Executive </em>and other outlets, however, reported that FEMA on Jan. 22 <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2026/01/some-fema-employee-layoffs-put-hold-while-reform-council-renewed/410950/?oref=ge-author-river\">paused the blanket nonrenewals</a>, as the disaster agency was responding to the recent winter storm. About 900 to 1,000 CORE employees have contract deadline dates in January, according to the filing.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The elimination of CORE positions on a rolling basis based on [termination date] is indiscriminate and unrelated to any workforce requirements, actual agency need or statutory mandate,&rdquo; according to the lawsuit. &ldquo;The lack of planning for this directive and the lack of notice to FEMA supervisors and employees prior to eliminating these positions will exacerbate the adverse impacts on the services the agency is required to provide.&rdquo;</p> <p>Plaintiffs argued that these staff cuts by FEMA and the Homeland Security Department, its parent agency, are unlawful because of statutory mandates for officials to maintain capacity for disaster response and recovery and requirements in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act that prohibit DHS from significantly modifying FEMA&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp;</p> <p>The complaint is supplemental to a lawsuit that was initially filed in April against the Trump administration&rsquo;s agency reorganizations and workforce reductions.&nbsp;</p> <p>FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p> <p>In September, the Government Accountability Office warned that past disaster recovery efforts have been impeded by staffing shortages and that <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/09/femas-staffing-shortages-have-hindered-past-disaster-recovery-efforts-gao-says-now-agency-has-even-fewer-workers/407871/?oref=ge-topic-lander-river\">FEMA now had even fewer employees</a> largely due to the Trump administration&rsquo;s voluntary separation programs for government workers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The compromise fiscal 2026 DHS appropriations bill would <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2026/01/funding-rescissions-re-staffing-initiatives-and-other-major-takeaways-final-fy26-funding-package/410843/\">increase FEMA&rsquo;s operational budget by 18%</a> and includes language to prohibit any agency reorganizations, office closures or eliminations in function without congressional authorization.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the House-passed measure&rsquo;s outlook in the Senate is in doubt following the shooting of protestor Alex Pretti by DHS agents in Minneapolis, which ultimately <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2026/01/path-averting-shutdown-remains-elusive-lawmakers-debate-dhs-funding/410994/?oref=ge-author-river\">could lead to a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday</a>.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Furious at the killing of two American citizens in Minneapolis, Capitol Hill Democrats say they won&rsquo;t give Immigration and Customs Enforcement any more money until it cleans up its act. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening in Minnesota is appalling &mdash;and unacceptable in any American city,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-statement-announcing-senate-democrats-will-not-advance-appropriations-bill-if-dhs-funding-is-included\">said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer</a>, D-N.Y.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., joined the growing chorus of senators saying they would not vote to continue ICE funding past the Jan. 30 deadline. &ldquo;Enough is enough. We need to rein in ICE&rsquo;s out of control conduct,&rdquo; she <a href=\"https://x.com/SenJackyRosen/status/2015172486392857019?s=20\">posted on X.</a></p> <p>Behind the fusillade are two important truths. One is that the Democrats are determined to use the budget, the only big tool they have at hand, to hold ICE accountable. The other is that pretty much everyone agrees that the budgetary process is broken and that using it in the middle of a pitched battle will only break the process more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nobody wants to drive deeper cracks into the budgetary process. But the Democrats believe they have only one option to deal with ICE: draining the agency&rsquo;s cash and shutting it down.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Democrats are playing the hand that the Republicans inadvertently dealt them at the end of <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/11/government-reopen-after-house-votes-end-longest-ever-shutdown/409477/\">last fall&rsquo;s shutdown</a>, the longest in American history. The House passed all 12 of the appropriations bills. The Senate passed half of them and held onto the rest. The Republicans, who controlled the chamber, could load them all into a &ldquo;minibus&rdquo; to pass them together or feed them into the process one at a time. They went for the minibus, a name borrowed from the 1990s for party buses. But they brought no party.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Democrats won the promise of a vote on health benefits and an extension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food benefits. And the deal continued the crisis already in progress, with the next phase this week.</p> <p>These crises have become more regular and more damaging, not just for the politics of the system but also for the basic order of the government. We&rsquo;ve been worrying about the erosion of trust in government but seem determined to make it worse.</p> <p>Six of the nation&rsquo;s biggest budget experts&mdash;Doug Criscitello, Ed DeSeve, Teri Gullo, Phil Joyce, Roy Meyers and Steve Redburn&mdash;have just collaborated on a manifesto, calling everyone to action for a &ldquo;Radical Reform of the Federal Budget Process.&rdquo;</p> <p>The team writes, &ldquo;Having endured the longest-ever government shutdown at the beginning of this fiscal year, even the most casual observers should see that the federal budget process is not meeting its most basic goal: funding the government. Nor does the process help leaders allocate resources to deliver reliable results for the American people.&rdquo;</p> <p>The budgetary process was always chock-full of politics. It lies right at the core of the system that uses government&rsquo;s power to figure out how to allocate always-scarce tax dollars. It was the biggest program that Madison and his colleagues had to sort out when they drafted the Constitution in 1787.&nbsp;</p> <p>But, as the authors of the manifesto point out, the system&rsquo;s politics are playing themselves out in new ways that hyper-politicize the process and undermine any expectation for doing things in a way that makes it possible for anyone to have reasonable expectations about anything.&nbsp;</p> <p>The executive branch is refusing to spend money that Congress appropriates and spending money that Congress hasn&rsquo;t authorized. The president hasn&rsquo;t made a detailed budget proposal. Congress isn&rsquo;t getting its work done on time. It&rsquo;s been 30 years, in fact, since it has completed its appropriations bills before the start of the fiscal year. And there&rsquo;s increasingly no connection between the money coming in and the cash going out.&nbsp;</p> <p>We don&rsquo;t have to keep doing this to ourselves. The manifesto lays out 10 characteristics of an effective budget process:</p> <ol> <li aria-level=\"1\">Comprehensive: including all of government&rsquo;s financial resources.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Legitimate: only legally responsible officials should make budgetary decisions.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Honest: decisions should rest on accurate and timely information.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Transparent: taxpayers ought to be able to understand budgetary decisions.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Timely: budgetary decisions should be completed on time.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Cooperative: the budget should complement, not compete with, other key decisions.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Perceptive: the budget ought to take a long-term view.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Judgmental: taxpayers ought to expect decisions that produce the highest value for the least cost.</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Constrained: the process ought to put brakes on how much policymakers can spend</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Responsive: budgetary decisions ought to match what the public wants</li> </ol> <p>It&rsquo;s been 50 years since we&rsquo;ve rebuilt the budgetary process, with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The nasty headlines make clear it&rsquo;s time to do it again. And the manifesto lays out a game plan for how to do it&mdash;now, and even better than the last time.&nbsp;</p> <p>But two things we don&rsquo;t want or need. One is trying to cut politics out of the process. That would be like trying to start a restaurant without ordering food.</p> <p>The other is gaming the process, as happened with the current minibus, is only looking for trouble.

    "description": "To better understand their potential benefits and financial risks in retirement, both spouses should be aware of some benefits planning realities.",
    "content": "<p><em>Updated at 2:59 p.m. on Jan. 29</em></p> <p>Planning for retirement involves more than picking a last working day or exploring new goals and hobbies. It also means understanding how your retirement choices affect your spouse if unexpected events arise.</p> <p>Federal retirement systems&mdash;including Social Security, Federal Employee Health Benefits, the Thrift Savings Plan and federal pensions&mdash;are complex and highly interconnected. Decisions made years before retirement can significantly affect a surviving spouse&rsquo;s financial stability, access to healthcare and administrative burden.</p> <p>Below are key areas federal employees should address well before retirement to protect their spouse.</p> <p><strong>Ensure both spouses understand the retirement plan</strong><br /> In many households, one spouse takes primary responsibility for financial decisions. While common, this approach can create risk if retirement planning depends entirely on one person&rsquo;s knowledge.</p> <p>Both spouses should be familiar with:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Who manages your financial life</p> </li> <li> <p>Primary income sources in retirement</p> </li> <li> <p>Key benefit elections</p> </li> <li> <p>Major accounts and where they are held</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, a federal employee who managed all accounts and benefits passed away shortly after retirement. Their spouse, who had never interacted directly with FEHB, TSP or pension systems, faced time-sensitive decisions regarding survivor benefits, tax withholding and healthcare coverage. Although assets were sufficient, the lack of shared knowledge led to delays and missed opportunities, permanently affecting income and benefits.</p> <p>Shared understanding of the plan is critical for smooth transitions in the event of a spouse&rsquo;s death.</p> <p><strong>Avoid the widow&rsquo;s penalty with smart federal tax planning</strong><br /> Discussions about death are uncomfortable, but planning ahead for the financial realities a surviving spouse may face is essential&mdash;particularly for federal employees and retirees.</p> <p>After a spouse passes, the survivor typically moves from married filing jointly to single filing status, which can lead to higher marginal tax rates and reduced deductions. Meanwhile, certain sources of income&mdash;such as a federal pension, TSP withdrawals or Social Security&mdash;may be reduced or eliminated.</p> <p>This combination of lower income and higher taxes is known as the &ldquo;widow&rsquo;s penalty.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Strategies to reduce its impact</strong><br /> Advance tax planning can help mitigate the widow&rsquo;s penalty. Federal employees can:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Manage the timing and type of retirement income</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider Roth conversions earlier in retirement</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordinate Required Minimum Distributions to avoid large tax spikes</p> </li> </ul> <p>While taxes cannot be eliminated, proactive planning reduces the likelihood of a surviving spouse facing a significant, unexpected increase.</p> <p><strong>Optimize Social Security timing for survivor protection</strong><br /> For married federal employees, Social Security planning is about more than maximizing benefits&mdash;it&rsquo;s about ensuring long-term income for a surviving spouse.</p> <p>When one spouse passes, the surviving partner generally keeps the higher of the two Social Security benefits. The higher-earning spouse&rsquo;s claiming decision directly affects survivor income.</p> <p>For federal employees, Social Security decisions often interact with federal pensions, including Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employee Retirement System. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) no longer reduces benefits, having been repealed under the Social Security Fairness Act for payments after 2023. Some retirees may still see survivor benefits affected by the Government Pension Offset (GPO).</p> <p>Delaying Social Security benefits can meaningfully increase the survivor&rsquo;s lifetime income. Coordinating Social Security with pension payouts and other retirement accounts can maximize protection for a spouse.</p> <p>Since claiming decisions are permanent, it&rsquo;s essential to assess both spouses&rsquo; benefits, income needs and federal retirement factors carefully.</p> <p><strong>Choosing the right pension survivor option</strong><br /> Pension elections are permanent and highly consequential. One of the key choices is the survivor annuity, which can directly impact a spouse&rsquo;s financial security and FEHB coverage after the employee&rsquo;s death.</p> <p>A surviving spouse often must be entitled to a survivor annuity to continue FEHB coverage. FEHB continues only if the retiree was enrolled at death and the surviving spouse is eligible for a survivor annuity. While reducing or skipping the survivor benefit increases the monthly pension, it introduces long-term risks that can jeopardize healthcare and income.</p> <p><strong>What a survivor benefit provides</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Ongoing pension income: Guaranteed monthly payments after death</p> </li> <li> <p>Continued FEHB eligibility: Maintains health coverage without disruption</p> </li> <li> <p>Financial stability during transitions: Helps cover daily expenses, medical costs and retirement obligations</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Key considerations</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>FEHB coordination: Survivor coverage often hinges on a pension survivor election</p> </li> <li> <p>Spousal age and health: Younger or less healthy spouses increase the value of survivor benefits</p> </li> <li> <p>Pension offsets and Social Security: For CSRS retirees, GPO can reduce Social Security survivor benefits; a survivor annuity can partially offset the loss</p> </li> <li> <p>Permanent election: Survivor elections are usually permanent, though marriage, divorce or remarriage can allow changes within set OPM time limits. New spouses can be added within two years of marriage, with corresponding annuity adjustments.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Evaluate whether life insurance still makes sense</strong><br /> Many federal employees assume life insurance is unnecessary after retirement. In reality, the need depends on financial risk, not age.</p> <p>Life insurance may still be valuable if:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Your spouse would lose significant income at your death</p> </li> <li> <p>You elected a reduced pension survivor benefit</p> </li> <li> <p>You want to replace lost pension or Social Security income</p> </li> <li> <p>You need liquidity for taxes, debts or estate planning</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>The role of FEGLI</strong><br /> Federal retirees can continue Federal Employees&rsquo; Group Life Insurance coverage, which can:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Supplement a reduced pension survivor benefit or Social Security</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide liquidity for estate taxes, debts or unexpected expenses</p> </li> <li> <p>Fill gaps that pensions or Social Security alone may not cover</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Planning tips</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Evaluate before retirement: Costs and coverage options are generally better before retirement</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on risk, not age: Decisions should be based on exposure, such as income replacement needs</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordinate with federal benefits: FEGLI, survivor annuities and Social Security interact&mdash;reviewing all together ensures long-term protection</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Protection is a process, not a one-time decision</strong><br /> Protecting a spouse in retirement is not a single decision, but a coordinated approach across:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Income planning</p> </li> <li> <p>Tax strategy</p> </li> <li> <p>Benefit elections (FEHB, pensions, Social Security)</p> </li> <li> <p>Insurance (FEGLI or private life insurance)</p> </li> <li> <p>Estate planning</p> </li> </ul> <p>When one piece is overlooked, the entire system becomes more vulnerable.</p> <p>Retirement planning does not need to be perfect. What matters most is building a coordinated strategy that ensures both spouses are protected and that benefits and resources can support either partner when they are needed most.</p> <p><em>This material was created for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as ERISA, tax, legal or investment advice.

    "content": "<p>The top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Finance Committee are asking the Social Security Administration to elaborate on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2026/01/doge-officials-face-hatch-act-referrals-work-org-aiming-overturn-election-results/410805/?oref=ng-author-river\">court filing</a> which stated that SSA doesn&rsquo;t know the full extent of agency data accessed and shared by the Department of Government Efficiency.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_ssa_commissioner_bisignano_on_then-doge_team.pdf\">letter</a> to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, Sens. Michael Crapo, R-Idaho, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked for a briefing on the recent court disclosure, writing that &ldquo;we take very seriously the SSA&rsquo;s stewardship of any personally identifiable information (PII) in its purview.&rdquo;</p> <p>The government filed the disclosure, dated Jan. 16 and signed by a Justice Department official, as part of an ongoing legal battle over DOGE access to SSA data.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tucked inside were revelations that DOGE associates circumvented agency procedures for data sharing and used unauthorized third-party servers to share data last spring. SSA still doesn&rsquo;t know exactly what data was shared and if it&#39;s still on the server.</p> <p>The court filing also described how a DOGE employee signed an agreement in March 2025 to share SSA data with a political advocacy group that wants to &ldquo;find evidence of voter fraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;overturn results in certain States,&rdquo; the court documents say. That group isn&rsquo;t named in the court filing.&nbsp;</p> <p>SSA made two Hatch Act referrals to the Office of Special Counsel last December because of the incident, which didn&rsquo;t go through the agency&rsquo;s typical data exchange procedures. The agency only learned about the incident &mdash; and the use of a third-party server detailed in the &ldquo;correction&rdquo; to testimony from SSA officials &mdash; during an unrelated review this fall.</p> <p>The court filing also says that, although SSA still maintains that DOGE never had access to agency systems of record, a DOGE associate emailed the former operational head of the efficiency team, Steve Davis, a file of SSA data. SSA doesn&rsquo;t know exactly what was in the file because it is password-protected, although the agency believes it was the names and addresses of about 1,000 people.</p> <p>The senators are asking SSA for a comprehensive briefing as well as written responses to a set of questions by Feb. 10.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those include what the agency has done to ensure that its policies for sensitive data are followed going forward, as well as how SSA is going to determine what data has been shared outside the agency.</p> <p>&ldquo;The disclosure suggests that the SSA&rsquo;s policies for granting access to PII were not consistently followed,&rdquo; the lawmakers write.</p> <p>Crapo and Wyden also ask that SSA share any additional discoveries about how DOGE accessed sensitive, personal data with the committee &ldquo;in a timely manner.&rdquo; The review of DOGE&rsquo;s actions at SSA is ongoing, the court filing said.</p> <p>An SSA spokesperson told <em>Nextgov/FCW </em>Tuesday that the agency &ldquo;is committed to safeguarding the personal data of every American.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Our systems are continuously monitored by career professionals in accordance with federal and industry security standards,&rdquo; they continued. &ldquo;We will maintain engagement with Congress about our data protection efforts.&rdquo;</p> <p>The new details about how DOGE accessed and shared SSA data follow a whistleblower complaint filed by the agency&rsquo;s former chief data officer Chuck Borges last summer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Borges, who has since resigned and alleged that the agency retaliated against him for speaking up, said at the time that DOGE employees created a live copy of sensitive SSA data on a vulnerable cloud server.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bisignano <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_from_commissioner_bisignano_to_chairman_crapo_091625.pdf\">told</a> Crapo that none of the data in question &mdash; the Numident database, a comprehensive file with sensitive information on each person issued a Social Security number &mdash; had been &ldquo;accessed, leaked, hacked, or shared in any unauthorized fashion&rdquo; after the Republican senator <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/crapo-requests-information-on-social-security-data-protections\">asked</a> for more information last fall.</p> <p>Borges&rsquo; attorney, Debra Katz, said in a statement issued after the latest court filings that &ldquo;the federal government has conceded that many of Mr. Borges&rsquo; allegations are accurate.&rdquo;</p> <p>In addition to Wyden and Crapo&rsquo;s oversight efforts, other Democrats in the House of Representatives are calling for a full investigation into how DOGE handled data at SSA.&nbsp;</p> <p>Reps. Richard Neal, D-Mass., Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., Robert Garcia, D-Calif., and John Larson, D-Conn. &mdash; the top Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, the Committee on Administration, the Oversight and Accountability Committee and the House Social Security subcommittee, respectively &mdash; <a href=\"https://larson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ranking-members-larson-neal-morelle-and-garcia-call-investigate-doge\">announced</a> last week that they would be filing a &ldquo;resolution of inquiry&rdquo; to formally compel SSA to hand over more information.</p> <p>The group is also asking for the courts to revisit decisions about DOGE access to data.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Supreme Court overruled a block on DOGE access to data in June, although the case is ongoing back down in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The court filing at the center of the latest oversight efforts also revealed some instances in which DOGE associates were given access to sensitive information even after the court had halted DOGE&rsquo;s access to SSA data.</p> <p>&ldquo;These new findings raise serious concerns about whether the Social Security Administration has been fully honest with the court about how sensitive personal information was compromised,&rdquo; Garcia said in a statement.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington, D.C.&rsquo;s non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives since 1991 and a longtime advocate for federal employees, announced on Tuesday that she will retire at the end of her current term.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The privilege of public service is inseparable from the responsibility to recognize when it&#39;s time to lift up the next generation of leaders,&rdquo; she said in <a href=\"https://norton.house.gov/media/press-releases/norton-announces-retirement-end-term\">a statement</a>. &ldquo;For D.C., that time has come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.notus.org/2026-election/eleanor-holmes-norton-reelection-campaign-termination\"><em>NOTUS </em>was the first to report</a> that Norton, a Democrat, was ending her reelection campaign after she filed a termination notice with the Federal Election Commission. At 88-years-old, there were widespread concerns about her ability to continue serving.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the voice in Congress for about <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47716\">160,000 federal employees who live in D.C.</a>, Norton frequently pursued legislation that impacts government workers. In recent years, she&rsquo;s attempted to rebuff many of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s efforts to overhaul the civil service.&nbsp;</p> <p>American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley said that Norton has been a &ldquo;loyal friend&rdquo; to the union.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Eleanor Holmes Norton has been a fierce advocate for federal and D.C. government workers during her decades of public service representing the District of Columbia in the U.S. House of Representatives,&rdquo; he said in a statement to <em>Government Executive</em>. &ldquo;She has introduced or championed countless bills to protect federal employees&rsquo; rights and benefits, and she has shown up for AFGE time and time again to defend our members&rsquo; jobs and civil service protections from attack.&rdquo;</p> <p>In March 2025, she introduced the Protecting Federal Agencies and Employees from Political Interference Act (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1807?s=2&amp;r=53\">H.R. 1807</a>) that would prohibit the executive branch from moving any agency headquarters or staffers outside of the National Capital region without congressional authorization.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under Trump, agencies such as the <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/07/usda-relocate-thousands-staff-outside-washington-consolidate-dozens-offices/406960/\">Agriculture Department</a> and <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/07/fbi-move-headquarters-reagan-building-seemingly-resolving-decades-long-fight/406463/\">FBI</a> have started transferring thousands of employees out of the D.C. area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The House in January 2025 passed, by voice voice, legislation (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/189?s=2&amp;r=65\">H.R. 189</a>) from Norton to revoke the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s authority to lease office space for itself and instead grant that duty to the General Services Administration.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://norton.house.gov/media/press-releases/house-passes-norton-bill-eliminate-secs-leasing-authority\">A press release</a> from her office said that the measure is necessary to keep federal real estate decisions in GSA.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the current Congress, she&rsquo;s also <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2025/05/senator-says-va-slow-footing-benefits-law-congresswoman-wants-watchdog-thrift-investment-board/405457/\">sponsored legislation that would establish an inspector general for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board</a>, which oversees the 401(k)-style federal employee retirement plan.

    "description": "About half of the federal government would cease full operations if Congress cannot come up with a plan by Friday night.",
    "content": "<p>Congress is barrelling toward a partial government shutdown at the end of the week, as disagreements over how to fund the Homeland Security Department and restrict its operations are threatening to upend a bipartisan agreement to fund much of government.&nbsp;</p> <p>About half of federal agencies are currently only funded through Jan. 30 and will be forced to shut down first thing Saturday absent congressional action. The House has already passed a package to fund those agencies through September, but they now face an uncertain future in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>The measures were expected to smoothly make their ways to President Trump&rsquo;s desk, but Democrats withdrew their support after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti on Saturday. They have instead asked for the DHS portion of the &ldquo;minibus&rdquo; package to be pulled out for separate negotiation while they approve the other five bills.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to DHS, the existing package would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies.</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the DHS funding bill &ldquo;woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses&rdquo; of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and said Democrats would withhold their votes from any packages that funds it.</p> <p>Democrats won some concessions in the spending measure, but far fewer than what they had hoped to achieve. The bill trims Customs and Border Protection funding by $1 billion. ICE spending would remain flat, but capacity for detaining immigrants would shrink. The measure would provide $20 million for body cameras for law enforcement at both agencies, though detractors suggested it would not mandate they be worn. It would also require agency personnel to go through deescalation training.</p> <p>DHS will still have plenty of funds from which to draw: the department was awarded $190 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, though lawmakers included in the new measure provisions&nbsp; requiring monthly updates on how that money is being spent. The DHS inspector general would receive an added $13 million for its oversight work.</p> <p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on Monday that bills were the result of difficult bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, as well as discussions with the White House. Reaching an agreement was &ldquo;not an easy task,&rdquo; she said, though she added she &ldquo;recognize[s] and share[s] the concerns&rdquo; with the DHS bill after Pretti&rsquo;s death. She highlighted the &ldquo;safeguards&rdquo; on immigration enforcement that were included and stressed the bulk of the bill goes toward non-controversial provisions such as funding the Transportation Security Administration, cybersecurity and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;I hope we can come together in a constructive way to get this done and to ensure that we do not lurch into a dangerous and detrimental government shutdown,&rdquo; Collins said. &ldquo;So, that is my goal, and I look forward to working with our colleagues this week to accomplish that objective.&rdquo;</p> <p>Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., the Senate&rsquo;s lead appropriator for DHS, similarly focused on the non-immigration provisions of the department&rsquo;s funding bill and said those programs &ldquo;must be funded.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;We know from recent history that government shutdowns do not help anyone and are not in the best interest of the American people,&rdquo; Britt said. &ldquo;As we approach a government funding deadline, I remain committed to finding a pathway forward.&rdquo;</p> <p>Senate Republicans on Monday initiated the preliminary procedural steps for the minibus package, setting up a vote on Thursday. They have so far shown no indication they are willing to split up the bill, which would require the House&mdash;currently in recess&mdash;to take additional votes on or before Jan. 30 to avoid a shutdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additional restrictions on DHS Democrats have sought include requiring third-party warrants to enter homes, additional training and performance requirements for new personnel and a prohibition on ICE detaining U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said policy discussions on immigration &quot;are happening,&quot; noting Trump discussed the issue with Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., on Monday. Walz has joined many Democrats in demanding federal officers end their extended operations in his state. The governor said after the call that Trump would &quot;look into&quot; reducing the number of federal deployments in Minnesota and work with DHS to ensure the state can conduct an independent investigation in Pretti&#39;s death. Leavitt said lawmakers should back the minibus as previously negotiated.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;At this point, the White House supports the bipartisan work that was done to advance the bipartisan appropriations package and we want to see that passed,&rdquo; Leavitt said.</p> <div class=\"related-articles-placeholder\">[[Related Posts]]</div> <p></p>",

    "content": "<p><em>This story has been updated at 2:40 p.m. ET.</em></p> <p>The nation&rsquo;s largest federal employee union on Monday called for the resignations of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the two officials&rsquo; statements denigrating VA nurse Alex Pretti just hours after he was <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2026/01/man-fatally-shot-border-patrol-agents-was-federal-employee-va/410923/?oref=ge-homepage-river\">slain by a U.S. Border Patrol agent</a> Saturday.</p> <p>Trump told reporters Tuesday that Noem would remain at her post, saying, &quot;I think she&#39;s doing a very good job.&quot;</p> <p>Pretti, 37, was an <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2026/01/violent-death-one-our-own-va-employees-ask-more-their-agency-after-nurse-fatally-shot/410948/?oref=ge-home-top-story\">intensive care unit nurse</a> at the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis before his death last weekend. Pretti had gathered with other protesters as Border Patrol was conducting what it called a targeted operation to detain an alleged undocumented immigrant. Though Pretti had a firearm, it was holstered as he approached officers holding his phone, at which point several agents tackled him to the ground and then at least one shot him 10 times.</p> <p>On Monday, the leaders of both the American Federation of Government Employees and AFGE Local 3669, of which Pretti was a member, demanded that Miller and Noem resign from their posts over statements they made Saturday; Noem called Pretti a &ldquo;domestic terrorist,&rdquo; while Miller described him as a &ldquo;would-be assassin,&rdquo; claims belied by the wide array of videos capturing the encounter and subsequent killing. Those same videos appear to show that Pretti had already been disarmed when he was shot.</p> <p>&ldquo;Alex Pretti was a patriotic ICU nurse at a VA hospital who devoted his life to serving America&rsquo;s veterans,&rdquo; said AFGE National President Everett Kelley. &ldquo;That claim [that Pretti was a &lsquo;terrorist&rsquo;] was reckless, defamatory and unsupported by the facts . . . Our demand is clear: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was responsible for carrying out the policy that led to Alex&rsquo;s needless killing, and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of that policy, must resign immediately. If they refuse, President Trump must dismiss them.&rdquo;</p> <p>In addition to representing VA health care workers, AFGE also has bargaining units within U.S. Border Patrol. Kelley said Noem&rsquo;s efforts to reshape DHS over the last year created the conditions leading to the death of two American citizens, following the slaying of Renee Good earlier this month, and the shootings of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/27/ice-border-patrol-shootings-immigration-trump/\">at least 10 others</a> since last July.</p> <p>&ldquo;Under her leadership, TSA workers have faced sustained attacks on collective bargaining rights and union representation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At FEMA, her actions have weakened frontline workers, undermined labor protections, and eroded accountability within the agency that is so critical to disaster preparedness and response. Over the past year, she removed senior leaders within DHS and reshaped the agency&rsquo;s command structure to ensure adherence to Mr. Miller&rsquo;s aggressive immigration strategies. Those decisions escalated tensions, undermined professional judgment, and put lives at risk.&rdquo;</p> <p>House Democratic leaders, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass.,&nbsp;and Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., similarly called for Noem to resign Tuesday morning, and threatened to begin impeachment proceedings if she does not.</p> <p>In a joint statement, AFGE Local 3669, which represents more than 1,000 workers at Minneapolis&rsquo; VA Medical Center, assailed the officials&rsquo; comments following the shooting and called for an independent &ldquo;third-party&rdquo; investigation into Pretti&rsquo;s death. They also took issue with VA Secretary Doug Collins, who issued a statement blaming Democrats for the shooting.</p> <p>&ldquo;AFGE Local 3669 is disgusted by the abhorrent rhetoric of Trump administration officials following his killing,&rdquo; the union wrote. &ldquo;Alex was a son, a colleague, and a fellow union brother, not an &lsquo;assassin&rsquo; or a &lsquo;domestic terrorist.&rsquo; We are especially disappointed with VA Secretary Doug Collins, who chose to use the murder of his own employee to push partisan, political narratives.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p>A suspected Chinese intelligence outfit contacted a former senior State Department officer late last year requesting they draft an assessment of U.S. policy priorities in Venezuela in exchange for payment, <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> has learned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The former official, who worked in a national security role while employed by the government and requested anonymity to speak candidly about their experience, said they wanted to speak out about the incident to warn other former federal employees, especially those in highly sensitive positions.</p> <p>A person claiming to be Keven Lee from a firm called Foresight and Strategy contacted the former official. Both Lee and the firm&rsquo;s name surfaced in research produced by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that was <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/09/suspected-chinese-operation-aims-recruit-former-feds-job-postings-research-shows/407970/\">first reported</a> by <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> in September last year. That research assessed that the firm is part of a nexus of fake companies and websites likely tied to China.&nbsp;</p> <p>The network has sought to recruit U.S. individuals with policy research experience, especially those who have worked in the government or at think tanks. The former official did not independently assess the group as Chinese-affiliated.</p> <p>The attempts to gain insights from the former official help highlight the extent to which&nbsp;foreign adversaries are willing to go to extract intelligence from former government employees to aid in painting a picture of rivals&rsquo; geopolitical views. It&rsquo;s also the first known public case in which the Foresight and Strategy network is confirmed to have sought out a former U.S. government employee for sensitive information.&nbsp;</p> <p>The outreach came amid a U.S. campaign of airstrikes against supposed drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, which legal experts have <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/legal-experts-fail-see-justification-continued-us-military-strikes-drug-boats/409957/\">questioned</a> the justification for. And it occurred just weeks before a <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2026/01/inside-absolute-resolve-regime-change-assault-venezuela/410440/?oref=d1-related-article\">major U.S. operation</a> at the turn of the new year ousted Venezuela&rsquo;s leader Nicol&aacute;s Maduro from Caracas and brought him to trial in New York.&nbsp;</p> <p>After a virtual job interview, a purported Foresight and Strategy executive asked the former officer over email to draft a 1,000-word brief on U.S. policy approaches toward Venezuela that should draw from conversations they had with other State Department colleagues. The red flags began to go up.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;They knew their target well here,&rdquo; the former official said in an interview, adding that jobless federal employees may be more desperate for paid work and could fall for these schemes.</p> <p>Former government employees have become a <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/04/china-trying-recruit-current-and-former-feds-intelligence-document-warns/404409/\">prime target</a> of foreign adversaries&rsquo; recruitment scams in the last year amid widespread layoffs, hiring freezes and growing uncertainty in the federal workforce. A State Department employee can be attractive to Chinese spies because of their potential access to diplomatic networks and insight into how U.S. foreign policy decisions are shaped.</p> <p><em>Nextgov/FCW</em> has asked the State Department for comment. The FBI declined to comment.</p> <p>A spokesperson for China&rsquo;s embassy in Washington, D.C., previously stated they were not familiar with the network of websites and said the nation opposes &ldquo;any smear and attack on China with so-called &lsquo;spy risks&rsquo; without factual basis.&rdquo;</p> <p>The timing of a Chinese-linked outreach scam aligns at a moment when Beijing would most want an insider view into U.S. plans for Maduro&rsquo;s government, said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p> <p>&ldquo;In November and December of last year &hellip; you&rsquo;re getting all these mixed signals about the boat strikes, the oil tanker seizures and military assets in the region. You&rsquo;re really wondering &mdash; is the U.S. actually going to try to topple the Maduro regime, or is this going to be a case where [President Donald] Trump declares victory and goes home?&rdquo; Ziemer said in an interview.</p> <p>China, one of Venezuela&rsquo;s closest Western Hemisphere allies and trading partners, &ldquo;wants to know about U.S. policy towards Venezuela and what it could signal about U.S. policy towards Latin America as a whole,&rdquo; he added.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/09/11/fdd-uncovers-likely-chinese-intelligence-operation-that-began-more-than-3-years-ago/\">research</a> that documented Foresight and Strategy as a potential front for intelligence gathering cited China-based domain registrations and shared technical infrastructure with other fake sites as reasons to surmise the firm is likely part of a Chinese operation.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very plausible that this infrastructure will continue to be used on multiple targets, and &hellip; it appears to continue to be used even after it&rsquo;s been publicly exposed,&rdquo; said Max Lesser, an emerging threats senior analyst at FDD who co-authored the original findings. &ldquo;The U.S. government would probably want to consider sharing this information with as many people as possible.&rdquo;</p> <p>The outreach is &ldquo;entirely consistent&rdquo; with what&rsquo;s been observed during periods of heightened geopolitical tension, said David Cattler, the former director of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.</p> <p>&ldquo;When direct access to institutions becomes harder, adversaries look for indirect ways to understand U.S. priorities, internal debates and decision-making culture. Former senior officials are valuable because context, judgment, and credibility don&rsquo;t disappear when the [agency] badge does,&rdquo; Cattler said in an email.</p> <p>While the targeting techniques are not new, they now seamlessly align with features of a typical post-government career, he added. The danger emerges when these requests subtly push individuals to leverage non-public deliberations or internal conversations, even without an explicit request for classified material.</p> <p>&ldquo;A few simple rules help: be cautious of unsolicited opportunities asking for detailed analysis on sensitive, current issues; do basic due diligence on companies and recruiters; treat requests that rely on non-public conversations or privileged access as a warning sign; if something feels rushed, opaque or oddly focused on &lsquo;how things work inside&rsquo; &mdash; pause,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Awareness and professional discipline are the best defenses.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "OPM removes language on back pay for furloughed feds from shutdown guidance",
    "url": "https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2026/02/opm-removes-language-on-back-pay-for-furloughed-feds-from-shutdown-guidance/",
    "description": "OPM's shutdown guidance also added a section stating that performance-based adverse actions against employees are allowed in some cases during a funding lapse.",
    "content": "With a partial government shutdown underway, the Office of Personnel Management has updated its shutdown guidance to remove references to the guarantee of back pay for furloughed federal employees once a funding lapse ends. OPM\u2019s previous shutdown guidance from September 2025 stated that furloughed employees will get paid once a lapse in appropriations ends, at the earliest date possible. The September guidance also referenced the 2019 Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA), a law meant to ensure retroactive compensation for both excepted and furloughed federal employees during government shutdowns. After President Donald Trump signed GEFTA into law in 2019 during his first term, both OPM and the Office of Management and Budget affirmed that excepted and furloughed employees would be given back pay as soon as possible, once any current or future shutdown ends. But during last fall\u2019s government shutdown, OMB officials backtracked on the guarantee of back pay for furloughed employees. Still, the spending deal that Congress passed to end the previous shutdown in November 2025 ensured that both furloughed and excepted federal employees would be retroactively compensated. OPM\u2019s more recent update to its shutdown guidance in January, however, revised several sections to remove references to back pay for furloughed employees, including in sections on federal retirement, health insurance and unemployment benefits. OPM\u2019s guidance now states that \u201cCongress will determine via legislation whether furloughed employees receive pay for furlough periods.\u201d The newly revised shutdown guidance also removed sections explaining the pay rates for both furloughed and intermittent federal employees. Language stating that \u201can employee is entitled to receive his or her rate of basic pay for the furlough time to the extent that he or she would have been in a basic pay status but for the lapse in appropriations\u201d no longer appears in the OPM document. Additionally, guidance previously clarifying that there will be no effect on the accrual of annual and sick leave for furloughed employees was removed as part of OPM\u2019s update. The new guidance also no longer contains references to reductions in force (RIFs), which were initially added during the shutdown last fall. An OPM spokesperson referred all questions on the changes to the shutdown guidance to OMB. OMB did not immediately respond to Federal News Network\u2019s request for comment. OMB recently made some changes to its own shutdown guidance , which now states that furloughed employees will receive retroactive pay \u201cwhen specific appropriations for such payments are enacted.\u201d Along with the revisions regarding furloughed employees, OPM added a new section on \u201cperformance and conduct\u201d to its guidance, telling agencies they are allowed to take performance-based adverse actions against employees during a shutdown, as long as the action is determined to be exempt or excepted. OPM said deciding whether to take adverse actions during a shutdown should be made on a case-by-case basis. \u201cAgencies should consider the unique circumstances surrounding each situation, presidential priorities, the agency\u2019s mission, and Office of Management and Budget shutdown furlough guidance,\u201d OPM wrote in the January guidance. \u201cAn adverse action could potentially be an excepted activity where an employee\u2019s performance or conduct immediately threatens life, property, or an ongoing exempt or excepted activity. In other circumstances \u2014 for example, where the subject employee has demonstrated a long pattern of poor performance that is not impacting or preventing the agency from carrying out excepted activities \u2014 it is less likely that taking such an action would qualify as an excepted activity.\u201d A partial government shutdown began last week, impacting employees at some executive branch agencies. The Senate on Friday approved a spending package based on a compromise reached between Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The House is expected to vote on the group of appropriations bills on Tuesday. Over the weekend, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said House Republicans should not count on House Democrats to pass the spending deal. But House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said Monday that she plans to vote in favor of the spending package. \u201cWe need to take these next 10 days to work to radically reform ICE,\u201d DeLauro said at a House Rules Committee hearing on the spending deal. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said during the hearing that \u201cfunding these missions isn\u2019t optional.\u201d \u201cWe can take the amended bill, or we can leave it. My view is that we should take it,\u201d Cole said. Impacted employees notified of furlough status Federal employees at agencies impacted by the partial shutdown have been notified of their furlough status. Federal employees impacted by a government shutdown are typically given up to four hours to carry out standard shutdown activities. The State Department notified employees about their status last Friday, but instructed all employees to show up to work on Monday, regardless of their designation. \u201cToday, you should have received a message providing you with your individual status, noting whether you are in an excepted or non-excepted position. However, at this time, I am directing all personnel, regardless of whether you are excepted or not, to report to work on your next scheduled workday as normal,\u201d the department\u2019s Under Secretary for Management Jason Evans told employees in a Jan. 31 memo. A majority of State Department personnel \u2014 about 62% of its workforce \u2014 are \u201cexcepted,\u201d meaning they work without pay during a government shutdown, but typically receive back pay once the shutdown ends. Evans told employees that the Trump administration \u201ccontinues to work closely with Congress on appropriations for FY 2026,\u201d and that his office would provide another update on Monday regarding \u201corderly shutdown plans, if needed.\u201d A State Department employee told Federal News Network that agency leadership is directing management \u201cto be liberal about determining what work should continue.\u201d The employee said the department, by contrast, \u201cvery strictly construed\u201d what work was allowed to continue during last year\u2019s record shutdown. During last year\u2019s 43-day shutdown, the State Department directed passport services employees to keep working without pay, even though this part of the agency is fee-funded and can normally pay staff on time during a lapse in congressional funding. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Education Department has furloughed about 87% of its workforce, according to its contingency plans from last year. Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, said in a statement that the department\u2019s work is now largely \u201con hold,\u201d and that employees are either furloughed or working without pay. \u201cThe hardworking public servants at the Department will once again not receive paychecks because they are either furloughed or working without pay,\u201d Gittleman said. \u201cThis comes nearly three months after the end of the historic 43-day shutdown, which forced some of our members to borrow money or use public assistance to put food on the table.\u201d",

    "description": "A new bill would establish a grant program that helps states modernize their identity systems, develop digital IDs, and protect against deepfake attacks.",
    "content": "A bipartisan House bill would create Treasury Department grant program aimed at helping states adopt mobile drivers licenses and other digital identity credentials that align with National Institute of Standards and Technology digital ID guidelines. The \u201cStop Identity Fraud and Identity Theft Act\u201d would establish an \u201cidentity fraud prevention innovation grant program.\u201d States would be able to use the grants to modernize their identity systems, develop digital ID\u2019s, protect against deepfake attacks, and defend against digital identity fraud. The bill was introduced by Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) and is co-sponsored by Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) \u201cIdentity fraud is one of the fastest growing threats facing American families, our financial system, and the integrity of government programs,\u201d Sessions said in a statement . \u201cCriminal organizations and hostile nation-states are exploiting outdated identity systems, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars and putting Americans\u2019 personal information at risk Foster said the bill would \u201cprovide states with the support they need to safeguard Americans\u2019 personal information and strengthen consumers\u2019 ability to protect themselves against identity theft and fraud.\u201d The lawmakers noted that the bill doesn\u2019t mandate digital ID\u2019s or eliminate physical credentials. States would also be required to spend at least 10% grant funding on providing services \u201cdesigned to assist individuals with obtaining any identity credentials or identity verification services that are required to obtain a digital driver\u2019s license or other digital identity credential.\u201d The bill comes amid persistent concerns about public benefits fraud. Digital ID\u2019s are viewed as one way of stemming fraud that leverages stolen identities. But the federal government\u2019s digital identity requirements have largely been disconnected from state governments, where ID\u2019s are issued, as well as tech advances in private industry. Last year, NIST finalized a new set of digital identity guidelines. They establish varying levels of standards for identity proofing, authentication, and federation technologies, including requirements for security and privacy. Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Better Identity Coalition, said the new bill sets a \u201chigh bar\u201d to help drive digital ID interoperability nationwide through the NIST standards. \u201cStates are still free to go do something else, but if you want federal investment to support some of this, you\u2019re going to have to follow what NIST has put forward,\u201d Grant said during an event hosted by the coalition and other groups last week. \u201cThat was a good way from our perspective to try and head off rogue implementations or whatnot, at least ones that would be supported by federal funding.\u201d At least 20 states and Puerto Rico have begun issuing mobile drivers licenses in recent years. The \u201cmDLs\u201d are digitized versions of physical licenses and are typically stored on a user\u2019s smartphone. The Transportation Security Administration also accepts mDLs or other forms of digital ID at more than 250 TSA checkpoints across the country. Meanwhile, an ongoing project at NIST\u2019s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence is focused on accelerating the adoption of standards and best practices for mDL\u2019s. The first use case under the project is focused on demonstrating the use of an mDL or digital ID to establish an online financial account. The next use case is focused on government services. Ryan Galluzzo, digital identity program lead at NIST, said the agency is working with Login.gov and the state of Georgia on the use case. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we can do it in the context of financial services, but how can we potentially use this in various different government contexts, as well,\u201d Galluzzo said at last week\u2019s event.",

    "description": "The review will assess all programs and determine next steps \u2014 whether it's renegotiating contracts or \"figuring out a way\" to qualify a second source.",
    "content": "The Army is conducting a service-wide survey of all existing contracts to determine where limited access to technical data is hindering soldiers\u2019 ability to maintain and repair their own equipment. The service began collecting initial feedback from the field last summer following Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s directive t o \u201cidentify and propose contract modifications for right to repair provisions where intellectual property constraints limit the Army\u2019s ability to conduct maintenance and access the appropriate maintenance tools, software, and tec hnical data.\u201d Jesse Tolleson, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, said the effort initially focused on a narrow set of systems but is now expanding its scope . The review is supposed to identify the extent of the problem and determine next steps \u2014 whether it is renegotiating contracts or qualifying a second source. In some cases, the Army may not even know what data it can access. \u201cIt may be a situation where we wouldn\u2019t have to go that route as far as trying to negotiate. I think this would be us figuring out a way to qualify a second source for a lot of other options that we could do. But that will be, or it could be, a situation where we go back in and we really take a look at the contract itself and figure out exactly what access to IP do we really have? Maybe we already have general purpose rights but we\u2019re just not aware of it. That\u2019s, I think, why doing this service-wide survey is going to be extremely helpful, and then we\u2019ll actually be able to identify the full scope and breadth of the issue,\u201d Tolleson told Federal News Network at the Army Technical Exchange Meeting on Jan. 30. Tolleson said the survey is expected to be completed \u201cvery soon\u201d \u2014 possibly within the next 30 days. The effort will also position the Army to comply with the fiscal 2026 defense policy bill requirements. Despite its popularity and broad bipartisan support, right-to-repair provisions that would have given the Pentagon greater control over equipment repairs were ultimately stripped from the compromise version of the 2026 defense policy bill after industry pushback . Instead, the bill requires DoD to develop a digital system that would track and manage all technical data and verify whether contractors and subcontractors comply with contract requirements related to technical data. It also requires the department to review all existing contracts to determine what contractors were required to deliver and what data DoD can access. \u201cI think it was something that they felt like they had to compromise on, I guess. We were already leaning forward and doing the study, but I think it lays the foundation for us to continue to work with Congress to figure out the best way forward,\u201d Tolleson said. While the service plans to work with Congress as it heads into fiscal 2027, it is too early to identify what form of legislative help it might need moving forward. \u201cIt is probably something we think we can do a lot inside, as far as taking steps on our own to really start to ensure that we have the right level of access to all IP that we would need to make necessary repairs or just do regular maintenance,\u201d Tolleson said. Meanwhile, the Army is also moving to include the right to repair provisions into all new contracts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a two-pronged process. One \u2014 going forward with any new contract for a new system, we will have a right to repair clause as part of that contract. And then what we need to do now is figure out where are the contracts and the systems that we have issues with and what to do about that,\u201d Tolleson said. \u201c You\u2019ve already seen some of our [requests for proposal] that have come out and they have the right to repair in there.\u201d When the right to repair provisions didn\u2019t make it into the final 2026 defense policy bill, Senate lawmakers said they \u201csupport the Pentagon using the full extent of its existing authorities to insist on right to repair protections when it purchases equipment from contractors.\u201d G reg Williams, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight, said it would likely be challenging for contracting officers to effectively implement right to repair across thousands of contracts without legislation that enforces consistency.

    "content": "For federal agency leaders, public key infrastructure (PKI) has long been viewed as necessary plumbing. It is essential for security, yet invisible until it breaks. However, as agencies accelerate toward zero trust architectures, phishing-resistant MFA, greater operational efficiency, and face the looming reality of post-quantum cryptography, that plumbing is showing its age. Today, the legacy PKI environments underpinning federal identity, credential and access management (ICAM) have become a significant operational liability, draining budgets and slowing mission velocity. The challenge facing federal executives is not merely technical age; it is a crisis of complexity. Most agencies are currently operating infrastructures that have evolved organically over two decades, resulting in a patchwork of on-premises technologies. It is common to find an agency juggling Entrust, Microsoft, and a scattering of other certificate authorities (CAs) deployed on-premises with expensive hardware security modules (HSMs). Many times these are stitched together by costly professional services contracts because PKI experts are hard to find. This fragmented approach imposes a \u201chidden tax\u201d on agency operations. Beyond the hard costs which can exceed $1 million annually for maintenance and licensing, there is a profound cost in human capital and agility. When credential issuance relies on manual processes and disjointed approval chains, simple tasks like issuing derived PIV credentials or compiling simple compliance documents can drag on for weeks or months. Furthermore, the lack of unified visibility across ten or more independent CAs creates blind spots, leading to \u201cghost certificates\u201d and unexpected expirations that cause preventable service outages. The strategic pivot to cloud-native PKI To break this cycle of rising costs and diminishing returns, federal leaders must look beyond incremental upgrades and embrace a fundamental architectural shift: the transition to automated credential management and cloud-native PKI-as-a-Service (PKIaaS). This is not simply a technology refresh; it is a consolidation strategy that transforms PKI from a burden into a service. By retiring on-premises systems and moving to a FedRAMP-authorized service, agencies can achieve a dramatic reversal in their cost structures. Modernization reduces annual operating costs by approximately 60%. These savings are derived not just from eliminating hardware refresh cycles, but from shedding the massive overhead of on-premises deployments including facilities, software and hardware, as well as compliance and professional services. In a modern model, the heavy lifting of compliance, including HSM management and annual third-party assessments, is absorbed by the service provider, reducing the agency\u2019s audit burden by nearly two-thirds. Operational velocity and mission focus The value of modernization extends well beyond the balance sheet. In the zero trust era, identity is the new perimeter, and the speed at which an agency can provision trust determines its operational tempo. Automation is the key driver here. By replacing manual workflows with policy-driven automation, agencies can accelerate certificate provisioning by 80%, reducing issuance times to minutes. This efficiency dividend allows ICAM leaders to repurpose their most valuable asset: their people. Instead of dedicating subject matter experts to \u201coperational firefighting,\u201d such as patching servers or manually tracking renewals, staff can be redirected toward strategic initiatives like zero trust implementation and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) readiness. This effectively mitigates the risks associated with the federal skills gap and the retirement of legacy PKI experts. A risk-mitigated path to transformation Agencies often hesitate to modernize critical infrastructure out of fear of disruption. However, the path to cloud-native PKI is well-charted. A structured, 18-to-24-month roadmap allows for a zero-downtime migration and a gradual budget reallocation through carefully orchestrated parallel operations. By running the modern PKIaaS platform alongside legacy systems, agencies can migrate users and devices in controlled waves, starting with low-risk internal SSL certificates and PIV-compatible authentication, then progressing to mission-critical credentials. Integration with existing CAs and Federal PKI Bridge relationships ensures that trust chains remain intact throughout the transition. Ultimately, modernizing PKI is a matter of fiscal responsibility and mission readiness. The status quo of maintaining a sprawling, manual and expensive legacy infrastructure is no longer sustainable. By consolidating disparate systems into a unified, automated and cloud-native environment, federal agencies can secure their future, empower their workforce, and deliver measurable value to the mission.

    "content": "The hype surrounding the rise of generative AI illustrates a core reason why federal IT initiatives often fail: Driven by a \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d many adopters rush in without necessary preparation. This failure rate is not limited to the government. In a recent report , MIT found that 95% of organizations are getting zero return on their investments in generative AI. This holds true for the government largely because federal mandates and compliance drivers push agencies to adopt technologies before establishing strategic architecture ahead of deployment \u2014 a \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d mentality. To reverse this trend, agency leaders should adopt new cultures and methods to ensure IT projects are more tightly aligned with mission goals. The solution is not one based predominantly on technology. Leaders should take a \u201cnon-technical moment\u201d to adopt frameworks that ensure their agencies are measuring not just the effectiveness of the technologies they deploy, but also the returns on investment in terms of meeting mission goals. This requires a deliberate pause in the implementation process to evaluate existing governance processes and identify gaps. This pause ensures future flexibility, allowing agencies to ensure the appropriate architecture is in place to update or replace technology later without disruption. This process relies on a top-down, federated enterprise architecture model led by a central enterprise architecture function. It ensures new technologies are selected and implemented based on strategic alignment, defined architectural requirements and enterprise-wide collaboration, minimizing the risk of choosing suboptimal products by ensuring capabilities are selected based on three strategic phases. Strategic alignment and definition (the \u201cwhy\u201d): This phase defines the problem and validates the initiative\u2019s necessity. Teams must define the required business capability \u2014 focusing on business value rather than technology features \u2014 and link it to enterprise goals, such as reducing costs or increasing market share. For example, a team might articulate a need for real-time inventory tracking rather than a specific software package. The final step is to define use cases. Teams should document specific user requirements that the capability must satisfy based on business needs to justify the investment. Architectural requirements (the \u201chow\u201d): This phase establishes technical guardrails and requirements, deliberately avoiding product names. Teams identify the necessary technology capabilities and platform components (e.g., data ingestion or workflow orchestration) required to support the business capability. The team then establishes the non-functional requirements (e.g., security, scalability, latency) to serve as definitive pass/fail criteria. Finally, teams then specify and document mandatory architectural constraints and principles, such as the mandatory use of an approved cloud provider or a requirement to integrate with the organization\u2019s existing enterprise identity system, for example. Solution evaluation and roadmap (the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d): In this final phase, the organization uses the defined architecture to objectively select and implement a solution. Decisions are based strictly on how well the solution meets the established capability requirements and strategic goals. We often blame technology when government IT projects fail to meet their goals. However, by shifting focus to the non-technical planning outlined above, agencies can tackle the root of the problem. By prioritizing planning and enterprise architectures, government agencies can ensure they employ the latest technology in ways that align with and serve the mission.

    "description": "\"It does seem like this is being taken seriously across the administration,\" Chris Griesedieck said.",
    "content": "Interview transcript Terry Gerton The president\u2019s executive order from January 7 that focused on addressing underperforming defense contractors has certainly generated a lot of interest over the past few weeks. What\u2019s the latest that you\u2019re hearing on the legal front? Chris Griesedieck Well, the most recent development that I saw actually came out of the Davos Forum just a couple of days ago. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was there and he was asked about this executive order and he said, in terms of the defense primes, they\u2019re no different from systemically important banks and they exist at the pleasure of the United States of America to serve our national defense and they failed. Those are his words, and he thinks that many of them are five to seven years behind and their deliveries. And he thinks that this new executive order, the restrictions that are in it, should be in place for two to three years or as long as it takes to reach some normalized level of backlog, is the term that he used. So it does seem like this is being taken seriously across the administration. Terry Gerton Well, there are some terms in this executive order that would benefit from some clarity, things like underperforming contractor, large contractor, even defense contractor. How do you understand those terms being applied? Chris Griesedieck Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. Right now, we don\u2019t have guidance on both the undefined standards and the undefined application. So we don\u2019t know exactly which contractors for the Department of War or the Department of Defense, whichever term you want to use these days, are going to be subject to this. It seems initially focused on the larger prime contractors who focus on weapons systems, at least initially. But moving forward, we don\u2019t know whether or not there will be exemptions for producers of commercial items, for example. We don\u2019t know whether or not service providers as opposed to manufacturers might be exempt or whether or small businesses could be exempt from portions of this executive order or non-traditional defense contractors. And then to your point, the standards for what it means to be underperforming or to not be investing sufficient capital in capacity or to not be prioritizing government contracts, those are all undefined as well. So one would hope we\u2019ll get the guidance moving forward with more objective criteria, but there\u2019s the risk that it could be more subjective and we\u2019ll just have to see how it\u2019s gonna be implemented. Terry Gerton Acquisition of major defense weapons systems is a really complicated space, and the federal government has some responsibility here as well, I would think. The government has been known to change its requirements, to change its funding strategy, to change its acquisition strategy in the middle of a buy. How does this executive order assign responsibility, and will the defense contractors have a chance to make their argument that, hey, this wasn\u2019t our fault. Chris Griesedieck The contractor is supposed to have a chance to make their case, but the fact that it wasn\u2019t their fault is not expressly listed as one of the considerations. The executive order does say that the secretary of war or defense is going to consider whether to initiate any enforcement action and take into account certain things, such as the financial condition of the contractor or the economic viability of relevant programs. But the extent to which the government might itself be at fault or partially to blame for the issue is not listed, although I agree with you, it seems to me that would be relevant. And then, you know, thinking through things a little bit more, if you look at the executive order, it says that it has to be implemented in accordance with existing law, right? And so, one would think that if one of the mechanisms for enforcement here is going to be what\u2019s already in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or the Defense FAR Supplement, such as terminating a contract for default \u2014 you can\u2019t terminate a contractor for default if it was the government\u2019s fault, whatever the underlying issue was, right? The contractor could sue and seek to have that T for D converted into a termination for convenience instead. So you know. Whether or not the government had some hand in the issue that led to the government thinking that there needed to be remediation, it would be relevant to the enforcement action that could be brought in relation to this executive order, even though the executive order doesn\u2019t really talk about it expressly. Terry Gerton I\u2019m speaking with Chris Griesedieck, he\u2019s a partner with Venable. So let\u2019s go back to the structure of these companies, because many of the major primes and even the mid-tier defense contractors have diversified portfolios. Defense may not be their own business. So how will this EO affect companies whose defense business is only part of their surprise. Chris Griesedieck Yeah, I think that\u2019s probably the biggest concern. And, you know, we mentioned before Secretary Bessent\u2019s statement that these defense primes existed at the pleasure of the United States of America. That\u2019s not really true for a lot of these companies who serve the Department of Defense these days. A lot of them are primarily commercial providers. And in fact, this administration has really placed a bigger emphasis on trying to buy commercially where possible. And so I think it would come as a surprise to a lot of commercial providers that the government wants to get involved in sort of core corporate governance matters, such as how CEOs are paid, what their compensation structure looks like, whether or not you\u2019re going to be able to be involved in a stock buyback or corporate dividend. Those are all the sorts of things that I think commercial providers are not used to the government having a hand in, at least not in the way that\u2019s contemplated here. So that would be new, and I think it should cause anybody considering getting into the government contract space for the first time, or at least the defense contracting space, it should give them maybe not pause, but they should really consider, do I want to get in this space, and what\u2019s it going to mean for me? Terry Gerton One of the other angles I think that\u2019s interesting here is that many of the U.S. defense primes also sell to other countries, right? They may sell to our allies, they may be part of foreign military sales. How is that going to get factored into these considerations? Chris Griesedieck So that\u2019s one of the hammers that is potentially going to be brought to bear according to the executive order. If a contractor is identified for remediation, which the executive order basically says that if you\u2019ve done a stock buyback or a corporate dividend or distribution during a period of time where the secretary of war finds that you have been underperforming or not investing sufficient capital, etc., then you\u2019re gonna get somebody who\u2019s gonna come to you and say, we need to do something about this. And that something could potentially be, you know, a negative performance rating, or it could be a termination or the government not opting to renew the contract, but it could other things too. And one of them that\u2019s expressly invoked is this idea that the government might not support you when it comes to a direct commercial sale or a foreign military sale. And those, for people who don\u2019t really deal in that world a lot. You\u2019re right, they\u2019re basically selling defense materials to foreign governments. The two work a little bit differently. One of them is a direct transaction with that foreign government that is approved in some way by the Department of State and others in the government, or the other one, an FMS sale, is where DoD is more like an intermediary for it. But your support and approval to move forward with those could be in jeopardy as a result of this executive order. That\u2019s the basic narrative that needs to come out of this. And people need to consider that. And if you look at the FMS market and DCS as well, it\u2019s a lot of money. It\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars. And so people\u2019s ears should be perking up, I think, to hear that that could be invoked. Terry Gerton So the EO doesn\u2019t tell us specifically how DoD is going to evaluate companies and what that process is going to look like, but eventually, somehow someone is gonna get notified that they\u2019re an underperforming defense company. What happens next in the process? Chris Griesedieck So the EO says you\u2019re supposed to get notice, and then you basically get 15 days to try to resolve it with the Department of Defense. And that might include submitting a remediation plan that\u2019s been approved by the board of directors for your company. And perhaps the reference to a board in there suggests the kind of entities that are being targeted, at least initially, large companies that have a board of director as opposed to other entities that don\u2019t. And then, if you don\u2019t resolve it within that 15-day period, you know, that\u2019s when the enforcement could start happening. And so I think that\u2019s another thing that people really need to be considering now is if you feel like you could potentially get on this list, particularly if you are a manufacturer of critical weapons and you\u2019re a prime contractor for the DoD, you should be doing a review right now of your contracts to determine, is there going to be an allegation that we\u2019re underperforming or that we are not investing sufficient capital in some way in the overall defense capacity of the country or in production facilities. And if you feel like you might be targeted for one of these remediation efforts, you should be looking at your buyback history and your distribution history and your executive pay packages to see whether or not they are compliant with what the expectations may be moving forward. Terry Gerton That\u2019s really helpful. And I\u2019d like to dig in a little bit more to what these boards and compliance teams should be looking at. Presumably all of these things have been reported and provided in routine filings. If you\u2019re part of the compliance team or the board that\u2019s worried about audits and SEC filings and those kinds of things, what should you be thinking about specifically? And if you think you\u2019re okay, Should you be engaging with DoD early? Chris Griesedieck Yeah. So taking your first question first there, you know, I think that it would make sense to really kind of integrate the teams a little bit in terms of those who are thinking about SEC filings and corporate disclosures and things like that. And those who were a part of the core contracting side of things and really be thinking through what are our major programs that could subject us to review and scrutiny here and how are doing on them, you know? And if we think that there might be an issue, let\u2019s proactively think through what are the most likely ways in which enforcement would happen. Are we somebody who is deeply involved in the DCS or the FMS world? Do we think we are likely to get dinged based on the pay structure that we have in place for our corporate executives, for the C-suite? We know that one of the things in the executive order that they\u2019re going to be looking at is to put a new clause into contracts moving forward saying that that pay structure should not be focused on short-term rewards like EPS and it should be focused on on-time delivery and doing a good job for the government. And even if you\u2019re not going to be targeted, you don\u2019t think. If this clause is going to put into contracts in the near future, you\u2019re going to have to comply with it potentially. We don\u2019t know exactly which contracts it\u2019s going to go into. That\u2019s one of the most interesting parts of the executive order to me, is that this clause, it says any defense contract. It\u2019s not limited to critical weapons systems. And so taking that at face value, it could be very broad. And so you could see a lot of people who are gonna have to think through, do I really wanna bid on this new defense contract, given how we currently operate internally? And if not, you need to plan ahead for it.",

    "description": "\"Appropriations is the big thing, but there's lots of activity on the floors and off the floors as Congress gets down to work,\" Loren Duggan said.",
    "content": "Interview transcript Terry Gerton Last week was a pretty crazy week in congress we managed to maybe find some appropriations agreements what are you hearing right now Loren Duggan So there was some, as you said, concern last week about how to keep the government funded. This goes back to when federal agents shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and changed the dynamic around, in particular funding for the Homeland Security Department. Whereas the package that the House sent over, six bills, including Homeland Security. A take it or leave it approach with only the Senate in town, the Senate worked through over the week to find a way to get something through their chamber and back over to the House, which is what we\u2019re gonna see play out this week as lawmakers from the house return from their one week recess and figure out what to do with this package. Terry Gerton How close are they to getting agreement here? I feel like this is a little bit of Schoolhouse Rock. This bill\u2019s gotta go back and forth. What happens next? Loren Duggan I think we could see this package get through the one that\u2019s now five of the regular appropriations bills plus a two week continuing resolution for Homeland Security. That could get through and then that gives Congress two weeks to figure out what to do next on the Homeland Security Department. But with the six bills that had already been signed into place and once the other five are done, that leaves only one bill left for fiscal 2026 the year we\u2019re currently in. So, we\u2019ll see what they can do about that Homeland Security portion, which is not resolved by any means. It\u2019s going to be an interesting debate over two weeks. Terry Gerton So how close do you think they\u2019ll get to an agreement within two weeks? There are a lot of issues that certainly the Democrats have been raising about ICE and its operations. Loren Duggan Absolutely. And what restrictions they want to put on ICE and CBP and other immigration enforcement steps that are being taken. We\u2019ll see what that looks like. There\u2019s been talk about mask restrictions, which other jurisdictions have talked about not allowing agents involved in some of these activities to wear masks when they\u2019re out detaining people and taking other steps. So we\u2019ll see if that\u2019s in the mix. We\u2019ll if there\u2019s funding changes that people are looking for, but then on the conservative side, on the Republican side as well, there\u2019s some discussion about what you do about ICE operations and sanctuary city policies, which are when states and localities don\u2019t agree to comply with immigration enforcement or, you know, things like that. So I think you could see both sides of the immigration debate looking to this upcoming conversation and looking for ways to achieve their goals there. Terry Gerton You mentioned the sanctuary cities. That was part of Senator Graham\u2019s (R-SC) flag on the play, if you will, at the last minute. He threw a couple of surprises into the mix. Talk about the impact that that\u2019s had and where that will go. Loren Duggan He\u2019s secured agreement to have a vote whenever they get to this next bill. And, you know, that\u2019s the prerogative of any Senator to demand a vote. They\u2019re doing a lot of this by unanimous consent, which means if anyone objects, they can\u2019t move forward. So he was able to get some assurances from leadership. Thursday night, it looked like things were going and he seemed to be the main person objecting at that point, telling reporters that, you know, he didn\u2019t want it to move forward, it wasn\u2019t a good deal for ICE. So. He\u2019s going to get his votes on some of the issues he cares about whenever we get back to this other bill between now and presumably the 13th and we\u2019ll see what that looks like. Terry Gerton The Republicans really had to look to the White House for guidance on how to handle these disagreements. Were you surprised that the White house seemed willing to split DHS off from the other five bills? Loren Duggan I mean, I think the White House doesn\u2019t want another shutdown. That seemed to be part of it and move forward on some of these other issues and tackle what\u2019s going on with ICE. Last week we did hear a conciliatory tone from the president about his call with Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, obviously was on the ticket opposing him in 2024 and is now still the governor of the state of Minnesota. So it may have been completely surprising that they\u2019re trying to maybe bring the temperature down a little bit on some this and give Congress time to work its will. On some of those issues in potentially a bipartisan fashion. Terry Gerton I\u2019m speaking with Loren Duggan, he\u2019s deputy news director for Bloomberg Government. Loren, let\u2019s come back to DHS for a minute because all of the talk and the disagreement seems to be around ICE and a little bit of Customs and Border Protection, but there are a lot of other organizations under the DHS umbrella. What does all of this disagreement and extension of the funding deadlines mean for the rest of DHS. Loren Duggan As long as the CR continuing resolution is in place, they\u2019ll remain funded. But like you mentioned, FEMA, the Coast Guard, other operations like CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration, those all want funding in place so that they can continue to do their job. And two weeks of funding certainty will help with that, but they\u2019ll want funding going forward. One of the issues here is that a CR, these agencies under a CR under a full year appropriation would get funding. So they\u2019re working through that. And, ICE and CBP, one of the interesting factors here is they also have substantial funding from last year\u2019s tax reconciliation law or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and some people had even mentioned that even if you were to have completely shut down the Homeland Security Department by not funding it, those two agencies would have funding to keep operating. So this will provide certainty for all the components of DHS for the next two weeks and then we\u2019ll see what they do, whether it\u2019s another CR pulling last year\u2019s funding levels and rules forward or come up with a full year bill, which they had already basically written as part of the agreements in the House, but we\u2019ll see where that goes from here. Terry Gerton Well, certainly, the appropriations discussions got the big headlines last week, but there were a few others that snuck in around the edges. Secretary of State Rubio testified on the Venezuela operations. How was he received? Loren Duggan I think he got some tough questions from his former colleagues, and that was a big profile \u2014 he was a senator, he would have sat on the dais questioning the different secretaries of state, but I think overall he shared the administration\u2019s perspective, especially on Venezuela, but got questions about Greenland too and all the different hats that he wears with the different roles he\u2019s doing in the administration. So overall, he probably felt he escaped pretty unscathed, but it\u2019s the beginning of, we\u2019ll see a lot more cabinet secretaries up there and some who might get an even rockier reception during budget season and as other questions are raised about their performance in their jobs, you know by Democrats and maybe a few Republicans, too Terry Gerton We had a chance to talk with Sen. Van Hollen (D-Md.) last week, and he said one of the things that the Senate is planning is, as they take up conversations around 2027 appropriations, they\u2019ll be having a lot of those hearings and looking for those opportunities to extend their oversight functions. What are you anticipating there? Loren Duggan Yeah, I mean, we\u2019ll see what the budget request, when it comes, says about those things. But things that the departments have recommended, I\u2019m sure Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the HHS secretary, will get questions about vaccine policies and other changes being made there. And, you know, the list goes on and on as different administration policies are taken into account. Might see if DNI Tulsi Gabbard goes up, talk to her about some of her activities as well, and people are interested in knowing what she was doing in Georgia as part of the Fulton County election document collection that went on down there. So, you know, those budget hearings are a chance for people to go in and talk about the budget requests, but they\u2019ll get questions about all their other activities too. Terry Gerton What about the rest of regular order? What will you be watching for as the rest the week unfolds? Loren Duggan Somewhat closer to home, Congress is considering legislation to cancel a D.C. law about breaking some of the D.C. tax laws from the federal tax law. This is a chance for Republicans to invoke the Home Rule Act and overturn something D.C. did with, you know, kind of a federal-state interaction there. So we\u2019ll be watching that vote. And this could be the week that the House votes on holding Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt around the Epstein investigation as more files are coming out there. So, appropriations is the big thing, but there\u2019s lots of activity on the floors and off the floors as Congress gets down to work really for the year.",

And the G Fund, that short term government bond Fund which the TSP is now calling cash, which is a good description, was up 4.4% too. So across the board, we did well. There is, you know, the usual amount of volatility in the stock market in April when we hit the tariff liberation day, maybe it was called. We saw very sharp declines in April. The C Fund was down 15 percent. The S Fund was down 21 percent, which is a bear market. But if you held on and ended, you know, with great returns, C Fund was up 18% for the year, the S Fund 11%, I Fund 32% and the F Fund 7%. So altogether just a really good year. And I\u2019m sure when people opened their statements in January, they were very happy. Terry Gerton Well, let\u2019s walk through those Funds kind of one at a time, and let\u2019s start with the I Fund because of its amazing growth. Foreign stocks outperformed the C and the S Fund by the widest margin since the early 90s. What\u2019s going on there? Art Stein Two things. And one, the outperformance was really striking. But we also have to say that the I Fund, which is the foreign stock fund, the international stock fund has been lagging the two U.S. stock funds for years. But last year it was up 32 percent, which has almost doubled the return, not quite, but almost double the return of the C Fund, really about three times the return of the S Fund. And there are two things going on there. One, a lot of foreign economies are doing well and their stock markets reflect that. Second thing is that the dollar declined around 9 percent against the international currency index. That means the value of the dollar was going down. And when the value of the dollar goes down, the value of foreign stocks goes up in dollar terms, even if they have not changed in value at all, because one unit of foreign currency then buys more units of U.S. Currency. So the dollar is down about 9 percent and that added a lot of return too. Terry Gerton Are those durable changes so that people should think about maybe rebalancing in the long term for more international exposure? Art Stein Okay, I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to the value of the dollar. That\u2019s just so hard to forecast. The dollar was very, very high when we started the year, when we started in 2025. Other than that, I don\u2019t know. Nobody knows, Terry. Trying to forecast currency movements, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s harder than the stock market. There\u2019s so many things going on. But we, when my firm designs portfolios, we always include a substantial allocation to foreign stocks. Not anywhere near as high as the US stocks. And, you know, even if they don\u2019t do as well, they are diversifying the portfolio. And last year, portfolios, that was a big boost to returns. And I think foreign stocks are a good long-term investment. And I will tell you, it\u2019s also one, it\u2019s like the least popular fund in the TSP, almost no one invests in it. And that\u2019s pretty much true of Americans in general, who are doing their own investments. So, yeah, I think people should have an allocation to the I Fund. Now, maybe it\u2019s a lot, maybe a little, but I wouldn\u2019t change, I wouldn\u2019t increase my allocation to the I Fund because I think it\u2019s gonna continue to outperform U.S. Stocks, because we don\u2019t know that. It\u2019s just a long-term investment. We expect a positive return and it\u2019s going to reduce volatility a little. Terry Gerton I\u2019m speaking with certified financial planner Art Stein. So Art, one way to offset volatility is to buy bonds and the F Fund did pretty well last year. Talk to us about that. Art Stein The F Fund did extremely well, it was up 7 percent. But again, we have to say it\u2019s coming off some bad years for the F Fund. Even with the 7 percent return last year, the five-year return for the F Fund was slightly negative. And that\u2019s because we had a couple of years where returns were so bad, especially 2022, that it just wiped out all the good years. And so the average annual return over five years was this -0.3 percent. So not a good return. And again, something that\u2019s very unusual. Normally, over long periods of time, the F Fund\u2019s going to outperform the G Fund. I mean, historically, this is where I say past performance, no guarantee of future performance. But, currently, it\u2019s only the 15-year return that shows the F Fund outperforming the G Fund, and by a very small amount. However, I think what I see, and historically, one, the G Fund has not performed over long periods of time and should not perform. And both those funds as a major holding, you know like, because I know people, as I\u2019m sure you do, have all their money in the G Fund, and they\u2019re losing purchasing power every year once you take into account taxes and inflation. And it\u2019s what some people call the money illusion. You see the value of your investment go up and what you don\u2019t see is the value of the purchasing power going down. And that\u2019s a tough way to Fund a retirement. Terry Gerton In both the F Fund and the I Fund cases that we just talked about, you very intentionally mentioned five-year trends. Why is it so important for people to think about the historical trends of these funds and not just how it did last month or how it last year. Art Stein Because short-term returns don\u2019t really matter. Well, they completely don\u2019t matter to employees because they\u2019re not using the money. And actually for employees, if the stock or bond market goes down and they\u2019re investing bi-weekly in those Funds, it\u2019s good for them. For retirees, they tend to underestimate how long a retirement they need to plan for. And you know, people retire, say they retire at 65, and they\u2019ve read the statistic, which seems to be approximately true, that the average 65-year-old lives to 83, so they think, well, if I get my money to last 20 years, I\u2019ll be good. No, that\u2019s an average. And right away, we know that about 50% of the people are gonna live longer, but actually, federal retirees, on average, we can expect to live much longer than average, because they have great pension, social security, and that\u2019s subsidized health insurance, good health insurance. And those are the people in the United States who live longer. So I think you need to do your financial planning, assuming you live to 95 or 100, not because everybody will, but if you\u2019re one of the people who do, you want to be able to fund that long retirement. And let\u2019s face it, I think a good assumption is that medical care will be better 10 and 20 and 30 years from now and will keep us alive even longer. We\u2019ll have even more replacement parts and drugs and everything else. And so people need to assume they\u2019re gonna live to 95 or 100. Well if you retire at 65, and you\u2019re alive at 90 and you are broke because your FERS annuity has lost purchasing power because of inflation and social security doesn\u2019t do it for you and you run out of investments, That\u2019s a disaster, you don\u2019t want to be in that situation. Terry Gerton So Art, building on that sound advice as people are looking at their TSP portfolios for 2026, what advice do you have in terms of allocations? Art Stein It depends on who they are. I mean, you know, I think people need to look back at how they\u2019ve reacted in the past to, like, 2022 when the stock and bond markets were down, 2020 when we saw a 35% decline just kind of appear overnight. And if they were able to stay invested in the stock funds through those, didn\u2019t panic, then I think it makes sense to have you know, more than a majority in the stock funds. But, like, I\u2019m speaking to someone this afternoon who panicked about 15 years ago and pulled all his money out and just stuck it in the G Fund and left it there for 15 years. And I\u2019m wrestling, you know, what do I recommend to this person because he shouldn\u2019t be doing that but I recommend, you know, the people who are managing his investments and recommending a higher allocation of stocks, and then he panics and pulls out when they decline, and they\u2019re going to decline at some point. That\u2019s not good. Second thing I would say, Terry, is understand there\u2019s gonna be a stock market crash. Now, I don\u2019t know when, but it\u2019s going to happen, and people should have a plan for that. The plan could be, I\u2019m not gonna do anything, I\u2019m just gonna stick with it. What we do is if there is a stock market crash, after the crash, we sell bond funds to buy stock funds because we can buy cheap, but for some people, they just know that they\u2019re going to pull out and then they lose money. Terry Gerton It\u2019s all about knowing your risk tolerance, right? Art Stein Absolutely. Know yourself, know your risk tolerance, and know your long-term goals.",

    "description": "Funding is lapsing, at least temporarily, for the Pentagon, DHS and others. Essential functions will continue, but workers could go without pay.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The partial government shutdown is vastly different from the record closure in the fall. That is mostly because this shutdown, which started Saturday, does not include the whole of government and may not last long, even as it now drags into the new week. The House had hoped to pass funding legislation quickly when lawmakers return Monday evening, and that would have ended the shutdown. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., now says he is hoping to have the package considered \u201cat least by Tuesday\u201d as he scrambles to round up votes and Democrats hold out for deeper changes to immigration enforcement. Congress already has passed half this year\u2019s funding bills, ensuring that several important federal agencies and programs continue to operate through September. Nutrition assistance programs, for example, should be unaffected. Funding is lapsing, at least temporarily, for the Pentagon and agencies such as the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation. Essential functions are continuing, but workers could go without pay if the impasse drags on. Some could be furloughed. Why is there another shutdown? The government funding process had been going smoothly, with key lawmakers in the House and Senate finding bipartisan agreement. But the shooting deaths this month of two U.S. citizens, Alex Pretti and Ren\u00e9e Good , by federal agents in Minneapolis, changed the dynamic. Democrats were incensed after Pretti\u2019s killing and demanded that one of the six remaining funding bills, for DHS and its associated agencies, be stripped from the package passed by the House . They said the bill must include changes to immigration enforcement , including a code of conduct for federal agents and a requirement that officers show identification. Eager to avoid another shutdown, President Donald Trump\u2019s White House struck a deal with Democrats to temporarily fund DHS at current levels for two weeks while the negotiations play out. The Senate passed the five-bill funding package Friday, but it must pass the House again before becoming law. The House is not returning until Monday, ensuring funding will lapse for parts of the government, at least temporarily. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll do it at least by Tuesday,\u201d Johnson told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Have there been previous brief or weekend shutdowns? Yes, and typically the effects were not very visible to anyone hoping to use government services. There were a couple of these in Trump\u2019s first administration. In January 2018, a dispute over immigration protections resulted in a weekend shutdown. Some federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. Benefits such as Social Security and Medicare were uninterrupted, many people did not notice the shutdown and federal offices reopened the following Monday after a deal was in place. In February 2018, the shortest shutdown in U.S. history lasted about nine hours, overnight, and most people did not notice any impact. While agencies technically shut down after funding lapsed, it was so brief that furlough notices were not all sent out, and nothing was closed during business hours. What funding is impacted? The funding lapse affects the Pentagon and agencies such as the Transportation Department and DHS, which includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Experts have said FEMA should have enough money to respond to the massive winter storm still affecting large swaths of the country. FEMA would have about $7 billion to $8 billion in a fund for disaster response and recovery efforts and the staff who work on them. An extended shutdown could put more pressure on that fund, especially if FEMA must respond to new disasters. Other FEMA operations, such as the ability to write or renew National Flood Insurance Program policies , would pause, as they did during last year\u2019s 43-day shutdown. That shutdown took a toll on the traveling public as delays and cancellations mounted, and there is now a risk of air travel disruptions again: One of the spending bills awaiting House passage covers the Department of Transportation, which is responsible for the air traffic control system and its workforce. Air traffic controllers would still report for duty, but would be doing so without pay until a funding bill is passed. At the State Department, the shutdown will not have a significant effect for the general public, in the United States or abroad. Department employees were sent a 73-page memo late Friday that said passport and visa services and processing will continue and that embassies and consulates will remain open. Some functions, including nonemergency consular notifications and website updates, may be affected. But the memo said that 18,946 of the department\u2019s 27,206 direct hire American employees are exempted from potential furloughs if the shutdown continues. Will SNAP and other food assistance programs be affected? No. That is a major change from the fall shutdown, when many people had to do with little-to-no assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the final weeks of the government closure. The bill to end that shutdown funded the Department of Agriculture and the programs that it administers through the remainder of the budget year, which ends Sept. 30. That means full SNAP benefits will continue now. The federal food program serves about 42 million people, about 1 in 8 Americans, in lower-income households. They receive an average of around $190 monthly per person. Another key program fully funded for the year is the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, known as WIC. It provides pregnant women and young children with healthy food and nutrition counseling. ___ Kinnard reported from Columbia, S.C., and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP .

    "content": "War Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s recent memo for senior Pentagon leadership is ushering in a new era of acquisition reform for the military. The memo announces sweeping changes to address systemic challenges to faster acquisition. It emphasizes speed to capability delivery to warfighters as the decisive factor for deterrence and military superiority. 91% of defense and intelligence leaders say that accelerating the acquisition process is important to innovate for mission success. Source: SAIC 2025 U.S. Federal Leaders Mission Integration Survey Among other guidance, the memo addresses modernizing contracts, restoring the warrior ethos across the acquisition workforce and establishing portfolio scorecards and performance measures to track progress. This new direction is more than a call for faster acquisitions. It is a call for a new breed of partnership between the military and industry with commercial innovation and speed at the core. As national security organizations turn to industry for rapid innovation to maintain military superiority, mission integrators play a critical role. Integration is what transforms innovation into the operational capabilities that warfighters require for combat readiness. Leaders Identify Top Innovation Barriers National security agencies are not designed, funded or prepared to navigate the everchanging landscape of emerging technologies and commercial innovation. In fact, they face significant headwinds when it comes to driving innovation themselves. According to an SAIC survey, defense and intelligence leaders most often ranked rapid technology change as the top external challenge to mission success. These leaders also identified their biggest challenges to innovating to advance warfighting capability (Figure 1). Figure 1: Innovation challenges for defense and intelligence organizations to drive mission success The survey responses show that innovation talent gaps is the top challenge, followed by integration with legacy systems. Funding for innovation, unclear innovation ownership and lengthy approval cycles\u2014all of which are addressed in Secretary Hegseth\u2019s memo\u2014tie for third place. While innovation talent gaps is a clear outlier, the other nine challenges cluster closely together. This compressed spread signals that defense and intelligence organizations face multiple, comparable hurdles rather than a few dominant issues in innovation. The challenges are equally significant and span the innovation lifecycle, which points to a need for comprehensive solutions over targeted fixes. Converting Innovation Into Combat Power Breakthrough innovation increasingly comes from academia, tech giants and startups backed by private capital in a system that moves faster than traditional acquisition cycles. The memo\u2019s emphasis on harnessing commercial innovation to address the nation\u2019s most pressing national security challenges is a clear recognition of a challenging innovation environment. However, as the Department of War acquires commercial products and technologies under this new guidance, the critical challenge will be orchestrating disparate commercial technologies into unified operational capabilities. This makes integration critical; it transforms innovation into combat power. In this environment, mission integration is especially critical. It bridges the gap between commercial innovation and warfighting. Mission integration is proactive problem solving that makes funding go further, not consulting or reselling. It combines current systems, emerging technologies and best-in-class commercial solutions into a unified, mission-ready \u201csystem of systems.\u201d Critical capabilities work together rapidly, securely and at scale to deliver capability to warfighters. Mission integration can help the military optimize commercial innovation in four important ways: Accelerated execution for joint warfighting readiness. Mission integration supports increased speed and agility in responding to the rapidly changing threat landscape by design. The combination of an outside-in, model-based systems engineering perspective and modular, agile solutions shrinks long pilot-to-deployment timelines. With open architecture solutions, agencies aren\u2019t beholden to proprietary systems and upgrades are faster. Closing all-domain kill chains at near machine speed and providing U.S. and coalition forces with unparalleled decision dominance requires seamlessly linking fleets of globally-networked sensors, lethal platforms and C2 systems. SAIC\u2019s combat-tested communications and data backbone, Joint Range Extension (JRE) , enables U.S. forces and allied air, ground and maritime platforms to collect and exchange vast amounts of tactical data in real-time. Created in the operating system-agnostic Java programming language, JRE integrates easily into existing architectures and future platforms. Orchestration of the industrial innovation ecosystem. Mission integrators are natural ecosystem orchestrators that help national security organizations overcome bottlenecks and maximize the potential of commercial innovation and dual-use technology to support warfighters, allies and partners. They work with venture capital and all types of companies, from hyperscalers to niche startups that can lack the capabilities to integrate, scale and secure their innovations to be ready-now for classified environments and warfighting operations. As a mission integrator, SAIC participated in an important international exercise testing unmanned underwater vehicle (UUVs) in an operational environment . Working with VATN, a startup that builds affordable UUVs at scale, and Invisible, a commercial AI partner, we demonstrated effective, collaborative UUV swarms. The solution includes an autonomous command and control system that uses adaptive AI. This system can operate independently providing undersea diversion, persistent underwater surveillance or decoy, or a within the fleet without disrupting its design. Specialized understanding of military operations and classified environments. For commercial innovation to be military-ready, it must align with the complexities of the military environment. Mission integrators develop technology solutions through this lens. In addition, they have the knowledge to quickly bring together existing military technologies and commercial solutions, evaluating their applicability and impact on behalf of a workforce that may not have this expertise. The Department of War relies on software to support mission-critical operations across all domains. Yet traditional software delivery methods often have fragmented, slow and complex processes. Collaborating with Defense Unicorns, SAIC integrated the company\u2019s Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS) into our existing, robust software delivery ecosystem . This streamlined how we deploy and maintain applications across cloud, on-premises and tactical edge environments\u2014improving operational readiness for warfighters. Software teams can field mission ready applications more efficiently and cut delivery timelines from months to weeks or days. Mission owners can build once and deploy anywhere because the platform delivers containerized solutions securely to cloud or edge. Capability optimization beyond deployment. While mission integrators excel at ensuring that technologies work together securely, efficiently and rapidly, they also focus on what must happen after the implementation for sustained success. This assistance helps military organizations close innovation talent gaps by educating the workforce on how to evolve to optimize the system lifecycle. Sustainment engineering activities typically represent the longest-lasting phase and generate the highest total cost for any platform or system. But SAIC is exploring how AI can help optimize designs for better long-term performance and cost efficiency . AI-powered predictive maintenance can maximize operational availability, and AI-enabled performance optimization ensures that systems operate within their design envelope for mission success. Moving toward AI-driven maintenance and analysis makes it more possible to shift from reactive to predictive maintenance models. Rapid Innovation to Overmatch Adversaries Defense acquisition reform is an opportunity for both the Department of War and industry. Mission integration translates this shift into capability with urgency. By shedding bureaucracy to speed continuous innovation, national security agencies and mission integrators can work together to strengthen and sustain the U.S. military\u2019s combat readiness.

Leaders of the government\u2019s cloud security assessment program say they\u2019re increasing their engagements with federal agencies and the Office of Management and Budget as they continue to work toward a faster, less costly version of the program, called \u201c FedRAMP 20x ,\u201d but that they\u2019ve already made significant improvements. The focus on industry over the past year had a lot to do with the fact that agency budgets and personnel have been in a state of flux since the start of the new administration, said Pete Waterman, the director of the FedRAMP program at the General Services Administration. \u201cWe saw that coming really early here at GSA, and we chose to focus on working with industry partially because we just weren\u2019t sure who was going to be here in a year and what agency missions would look like,\u201d he said. But Waterman, speaking recently at an event hosted by the Digital Government Institute, said a lot has stabilized in recent months. \u201cPeople are a little bit more clear about what they\u2019re doing, what they have to work with, what type of tools and capabilities they need. So our program is really going to be focusing over the next three to six months on working with OMB and with the FedRAMP board to directly engage with agencies at the executive level, via the councils, via a bunch of federal sprints that are being run by OMB, as well as engaging more and more at the practitioner level,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the direction has taken shape and we started to deliver on results and build this thing out, the attitude has shifted. People are now starting to see the new FedRAMP as something that will give them access to tools that they need.\u201d And Waterman said a lot has changed in the year and a half since the Office of Management and Budget released a new policy that led to FedRAMP modernization a dozen years after the program\u2019s inception. Above all, the program is managing to authorize more cloud technology offerings more quickly \u2014 and with fewer staff and a smaller budget. He said the changes came after officials concluded the program was \u201cstuck,\u201d with more than a hundred services stuck in a backlog waiting for their final FedRAMP assessments. Refocusing on final assessments Waterman said dealing with that required some significant changes in the program\u2019s staffing priorities. \u201cAt the end of 2024, FedRAMP had more than 80 combined staff, but less than 20 people working on assessments. So we realigned our budget and staffing to make sure almost everyone would contribute directly to our core mission, which was that final assessment. Six months later, we had eliminated the backlog, and at the end of FY 25 our average review time had dropped from a year to under 30 days, which is where it remains today,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though FedRAMP is at the lowest staffing level and budget in more than 10 years, we have more staff dedicated to final assessment than ever before. That\u2019s an example of how we\u2019re truly mission focused.\u201d Next, he said, officials thought it was important to reset their relationship with the IT industry. That\u2019s what FedRAMP has spent most of the last year doing. \u201cIndustry was fed up with FedRAMP, expressing continuous frustration, not just to us, but to Congress and senior administration officials. Industry was struggling to parse unclear intentions and generally feeling disconnected from the program,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to address that, instead of keeping our cards close, we put them on the table. For trade associations that regularly work with FedRAMP, we established a new norm of accepting any invite to speak \u2014 unscripted, directly with their members. We also maintain a living roadmap that is updated every two weeks. We wrote intentional monthly blogs to highlight our activities. We hosted two government-wide FedRAMP day events with over 100 federal employees, and we hosted over 15 public events ourselves. We ran carefully crafted pilots with industry, and the whole time sharing the results publicly and continuously. We expanded our request for comment process to get feedback on nearly 20 new processes. So today, industry feels a bit more like a trusted partner in the program, because they are.\u201d But central to the successes has been a significant overhaul of how the program conducts its assessments. Piloting a new assessment approach FedRAMP conducted its first pilots under the new approach last year and is about to begin a second round. The new version lets vendors take credit for the security features they\u2019ve already built into their products \u2014 rather than mostly asking them to describe how they fit into the government\u2019s requirements. Before, Waterman said, the process was forcing vendors to leave some of their leading security improvements out of the versions of technology they offered to the government. That change, he said, has actually led to more robust security assessments. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about taking what used to be a once-a-year process where we asked people, \u2018Tell me about this thing, paint me a picture,\u2019 to, \u2018You need to build real, true, validated capabilities that will demonstrate the metrics and performance of your security program over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich would you rather have? A description of how someone plans on maintaining their program, or months, years, decades worth of pure security data showing ground truth of the decisions they made, good and bad?\u201d But over the long run, Waterman said officials hope a more robust assessment process will also be easier for vendors to navigate \u2014 with the assessment process itself built on a cloud-native platform. \u201cBecause so many businesses are built on cloud-native platforms where a lot of these activities are already being done via automation, via infrastructure as code, via APIs that they\u2019ve built and run, it will be easier for people to develop those capabilities and then reuse them across cloud services,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we see one company create a program that lets you attest to how you manage your infrastructure and how those changes flow through your change management pipeline all the way out to your deployed infrastructure. Then other companies that use that same process can leverage that, and they don\u2019t have to build it.\u201d Earlier this month, the program office released what officials think will be the final six requests for comment, with the final deadline for feedback set for March 11. Waterman says once those changes are firmly in place, the \u201ctransformation\u201d of FedRAMP will be essentially finished from a policy perspective \u2014 and the program office will spend the rest of the year focusing on implementation.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate voted Friday to fund most of the government through the end of September while carving out a temporary extension for Homeland Security funding, giving Congress two weeks to debate new restrictions on federal immigration raids across the country. With a weekend shutdown looming, President Donald Trump struck the spending deal with Senate Democrats on Thursday in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis. Democrats said they would not vote for the larger spending bill unless Congress considers legislation to unmask agents, require more warrants and allow local authorities to help investigate any incidents. \u201cThe nation is reaching a breaking point,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. \u201cThe American people are demanding that Congress step up and force change.\u201d As lawmakers in both parties called for investigations into the fatal shootings, Trump said he didn\u2019t want a shutdown and negotiated the rare deal with Schumer, his frequent adversary. Trump then encouraged members of both parties to cast a \u201cmuch needed Bipartisan \u2018YES\u2019 vote.\u201d The bill passed 71-29 and will now head to the House, which is not due back until Monday. That means the government could be in a partial shutdown temporarily over the weekend until they pass it. Speaker Mike Johnson, who held a conference call Friday with GOP lawmakers, said he expects the House to vote Monday evening. But what is uncertain is how much support there will be for the package. Johnson\u2019s right flank has signaled opposition to limits on Homeland Security funds, leaving him reliant on Democrats who have their own objections to funding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without immediate restraints. Two-week debate over ICE It was unclear how involved Trump will be in the negotiations over new restrictions on immigration arrests \u2014 or if Republicans and Democrats could find any points of compromise. Senate Democrats will not support an extension of Homeland Security funding in two weeks \u201cunless it reins in ICE and ends violence,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf our colleagues are not willing to enact real change, they should not expect Democratic votes.\u201d Similarly, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that any change in the homeland bill needs to be \u201cmeaningful and it needs to be transformative.\u201d Absent \u201cdramatic change,\u201d Jeffries said, \u201cRepublicans will get another shutdown.\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the two sides will \u201csit down in good faith,\u201d but it will be \u201creally, really hard to get anything done,\u201d especially in such a short amount of time. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay hopeful, but there are some pretty significant differences of opinion,\u201d Thune said. Democrats demand change Irate Democrats have asked the White House to \u201cend roving patrols\u201d in cities and coordinate with local law enforcement on immigration arrests, including requiring tighter rules for warrants. They also want an enforceable code of conduct so agents are held accountable when they violate rules. Schumer said agents should be required to have \u201cmasks off, body cameras on\u201d and carry proper identification, as is common practice in most law enforcement agencies. Alex Pretti , a 37 year-old ICU nurse, was killed by a border patrol agent on Jan. 24, two weeks after protester Renee Good was killed by an ICE officer. Administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, originally said Pretti had aggressively approached officers , but multiple videos contradicted that claim. Republican pushback The president\u2019s concessions to Democrats prompted pushback from some Senate Republicans, delaying the final votes and providing a preview of the coming debate over the next two weeks. In a fiery floor speech, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned that Republicans should not give away too much. \u201cTo the Republican party, where have you been?\u201d Graham said, adding that ICE agents and Border Patrol agents have been \u201cslandered and smeared.\u201d Several Republicans have said that if Democrats are going to push for restrictions on ICE, they will push for restrictions on so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that they say do not do enough to enforce illegal immigration. \u201cThere no way in hell we\u2019re going to let Democrats knee cap law enforcement and stop deportations in exchange for funding DHS,\u201d said Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., ahead of the vote. Still, some Republicans said they believe that changes to ICE\u2019s operations were necessary, even as they were unlikely to agree to all of the Democrats\u2019 requests. \u201cI think the last couple of days have been an improvement,\u201d said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. \u201cI think the rhetoric has been dialed down a little bit, in Minnesota.\u201d Last-minute promises After Trump announced the deal with Democrats, Graham held the spending bills up for almost a day until Thune agreed to give him a vote on his sanctuary cities bill at a later date. Separately, Graham was also protesting a repeal of a new law giving senators the ability to sue the government for millions of dollars if their personal or office data is accessed without their knowledge \u2014 as happened to him and other senators as part of the so-called Arctic Frost investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by Trump supporters at the Capitol. The spending bill, which was passed by the House last week, would repeal that law. But Graham said Thune had agreed to consider a separate bill that would allow \u201cgroups and private citizens\u201d who were caught up in Jack Smith\u2019s probe to sue. ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Stephen Groves, Joey Cappelletti, Seung Min Kim, Michelle L.

    "description": "The Senate passed a spending package on Friday, based on a compromise reached between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats.",
    "content": "Agencies are preparing for an imminent government shutdown, as lawmakers advance a spending package that would likely end the funding lapse by early next week. An Office of Management and Budget spokesperson told Federal News Network that agency guidance on a potential funding lapse been \u201congoing\u201d this week, and that it would direct impacted agencies to begin shutdown procedures once funding runs out Friday at midnight. OMB Director Russ Vought told agencies in a memo late Friday that, \u201cit is our hope that this lapse will be short.\u201d The Senate passed a spending package on Friday, based on a compromise reached between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The spending package will now head to the House, which is not scheduled to return until Monday. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) originally expected to fast-track approval of the Senate-approved package Monday evening under suspension of rules, requiring two-thirds of members to approve. But those plans changed over the weekend. The House Rules Committee will now review the spending measure on Monday. Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that he expects a final vote to take place on Tuesday, and that House Republicans will be \u201con our own\u201d to pass the spending package with a simple majority. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anybody would have a problem with this, though. Remember, the bills that have already been passed. We\u2019re going to do it again. It\u2019s a formality at this point,\u201d Johnson said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said on ABC News\u2019 This Week that the two-week stopgap spending plan for DHS was a \u201cmeaningful step in the right direction.\u201d \u201cThe one thing that we\u2019ve said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,\u201d Jeffries said. A short-term partial shutdown would have little impact on agency operations. Federal employees at impacted agencies would spend up to a half-day on Monday to carry out standard shutdown procedures. The IRS, however, told employees on Friday that all staff will be \u201cexempt from furlough\u201d through Saturday, Feb. 7, if the shutdown extends into next week. The agency began this year\u2019s tax filing season last week. \u201cEmployees should report to work on their regular schedules,\u201d the memo from the IRS chief human capital officer states. The IRS said it would operate normally using Inflation Reduction Act funds it received in August 2022 to rebuild its depleted workforce and modernize its legacy IT systems. The Senate passed a two-week continuing resolution for DHS and five spending bills that would fund large swaths of the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year. Those five bills include funding the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as several other agencies. The stopgap spending for DHS would give lawmakers more time to negotiate over guardrails on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement operations, following the deaths of two protestors in recent weeks. Democrats called for new restrictions on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement surge after Border Patrol agents on Jan. 24 fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse working at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. Pretti\u2019s death took place two weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot another protester, Renee Good. The guardrails Democrats are pursuing include an end to \u201cindiscriminate\u201d patrols by immigration officials and a prohibition on ICE personnel entering people\u2019s homes without a judicial warrant. Democrats are also seeking body cameras and a ban on federal immigration officials covering their faces. \u201cNo one thinks we\u2019re going to solve every problem, every single problem, in one fell swoop. But the American people are demanding that something gets done, and of course, to pass legislation and enshrine this into law. We need our Republican colleagues to come along with us,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Thursday, \u201cthere has understandably been a great deal of attention focused on the Homeland Security portion\u201d of the spending package, adding the fatal shooting of Pretti \u201cmust be thoroughly and impartially investigated.\u201d Collins said the DHS spending bill in its current form includes a provision that \u201cwould make such incidents as less likely to occur.\u201d That includes $20 million for body-worn cameras and $2 million to ensure that training requirements include how to de-escalate encounters with protesters. The bill also includes a provision that allows the DHS inspector general to review and investigate detention centers.",

    "description": "An administrative judge says CISA violated the rights of a tenured employee when they fired him using the rules for probationary employees.",
    "content": "An administrative judge for the Merit Systems Protection Board issued a ruling Thursday that gives employees who were fired shortly after their probationary period ended some hope that they will be able to keep their jobs. Denyzio Laboy was a federal employee in the equal opportunity employment office at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who was fired one day after becoming a tenured employee. The judge found CISA\u2019s actions violated Laboy\u2019s right to due process, including receiving at least 30 days advance notice and a reasonable time of not less than seven days to respond to the decision. \u201cAn agency\u2019s failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment, constitutes an abridgment of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law,\u201d Steven Giballa, an administrative judge, wrote in his ruling. Giballa said CISA was using the regulations under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.5 , which implemented President Donald Trump\u2019s April executive order and the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s regulatory change in June requiring agencies to review and actively sign off on probationary workers\u2019 continued employment before they can be moved out of a probationary period, in terminating Laboy\u2019s employment. But the judge said CISA circumvented the statutory protections provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511-7513 , and when a regulation \u201cconflicts with the statute, the provisions of a statute will prevail.\u201d Chloe Barrett, an associate attorney with Gilbert Employment Law, which represented Laboy before MSPB, said this was a small but important win for many employees who remained in their position after their probationary period ended and were still fired by their agency. \u201cBecause CISA terminated him on Nov. 6 and his probationary employee status ended Nov. 5, he was a tenured employee and CISA should have to give him minimum due process,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cAgencies are relying on this rule to forget to terminate employees during their probationary period, and then they are getting past their end dates and becoming a tenured employee. But agencies are saying under this rule set up by the EO, employees are automatically terminated unless you get a letter saying they certify the employees\u2019 employment. The judge says, in the case, CISA terminated Laboy\u2019s employment too late.\u201d An appeal is likely The judge ruled that CISA had to reinstate Laboy with back pay to November. CISA Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said in a statement to Federal News Network that \u201cCISA does not comment on ongoing personnel matters.\u201d Barrett said she expects CISA to appeal to the MSPB board. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a clear-cut error. I\u2019m not sure the board will see the merit in it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll agencies who are relying on this rule to fire probationary employees really need to look at this ruling and how they are applying the regulations more closely.\u201d CISA has until March 5 to file its request for review by the full MSPB board. Barrett said her law firm is working on several other similar cases where employees moved from probationary to tenured positions and then were fired anyways using the new regulations. \u201cWe have a client who continued to go to work for 2-3 weeks after the end of her trial period and they decided to terminate her. The agency didn\u2019t pay her for time after the trial period. The trial period ended on the 17 th of the month, but they terminated on the 9th of the next month,\u201d she said. Lawmakers push OPM to withdraw rule The Trump administration is initiating another change for probationary employees, moving their appeal rights from MSPB to OPM\u2019s Merit System Accountability and Compliance (MSAC). The comment period for the proposed rule ended Jan. 29 and the Office of Management and Budget says it received 326 comments. A dozen Democrat Senators wrote to OPM Director Scott Kupor yesterday urging him to withdraw the proposed rule. \u201cMSAC lacks the balanced governing board of the MSPB, reports directly to the OPM director, and has no demonstrated capacity to handle a surge in these types of appeals. Through MSPB review, there is a prudent separation between the agency setting personnel policy and the agency deciding if these policies are being applied lawfully,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cUnder this proposed rule, OPM could direct agencies to make probationary terminations and then adjudicate those same actions, eliminating any meaningful independence.\u201d The lawmakers, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), say the federal workforce needs to remain nonpartisan, insulated from political retaliation and have the right to due process. \u201cThis rule is antithetical to those aims. We urge OPM to reject this proposed rule and work with Congress to effectively manage workforce operations,\u201d the letter stated.",

    "description": "Voting could begin as soon as Tuesday, which would be day four of the partial shutdown. The Pentagon, among other agencies, saw its funding lapse Saturday.",
    "content": "President Donald Trump implored the House on Monday to end the partial government shutdown , but neither Republicans nor Democrats appeared ready to quickly approve the federal funding package he brokered with the Senate without first debating their own demands over immigration enforcement operations. Democrats are refusing to provide the votes House Speaker Mike Johnson needs to push the package forward as they try to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s deportation operations after the shooting deaths of two Americans in Minneapolis. That\u2019s forcing Johnson to rely on his slim GOP majority, which has its own complaints about the package, to fall in line behind Trump\u2019s deal with Senate Democrats. Voting could begin as soon as Tuesday, which would be day four of the partial shutdown. The Pentagon, Homeland Security and other agencies saw their funding lapse Saturday. And while many operations at those departments are deemed essential, and still functioning, some workers may go without pay or be furloughed. \u201cWe need to get the Government open, and I hope all Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting this Bill, and send it to my desk WITHOUT DELAY,\u201d the president wrote on social media. \u201cThere can be NO CHANGES at this time,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201dWe will work together in good faith to address the issues that have been raised, but we cannot have another long, pointless, and destructive Shutdown.\u201d The stalemate points to a difficult week ahead as Johnson relies on Trump to help muscle to package to passage. The president struck a deal last week with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in which Homeland Security would only be funded temporarily, though Feb. 13, as Congress debates changes to immigration enforcement operations. The Senate overwhelmingly approved the package with the rest of the government funding ahead of Saturday\u2019s deadline. Democrats demand changes to ICE House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries made it clear Monday that his side sees no reason to help Johnson push the bill forward in a procedural step, something that the majority party typically handles on its own. With Johnson facing a revolt from his own Republican ranks, Jeffries is seizing the leverage it provides Democrats to demand changes to immigration operations. \u201cOn rare occasions have we stepped in to deal with Republican dysfunction,\u201d Jeffries said at the Capitol. Democrats are demanding restraints on Immigration and Customs Enforcement that go beyond $20 million for body cameras that already is in the bill. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Monday that officers on the ground in Minneapolis, including ICE, will be immediately issued body-worn cameras, and the program would be expanded nationwide as funding is available. But Democrats are pressing for more. They want to require that federal immigration agents unmask \u2014 noting that few, if any, other law enforcement agencies routinely mask themselves in the U.S. \u2014 and they want officers to rely on judicial, rather than administrative, warrants in their operations. They also want an end to roving patrols, amid other changes. Jeffries said the administration needs to begin negotiations now, not over the next two weeks, on changes to immigration enforcement operations. Certain Democrats, however, are splintering with the leader, and pushing for quicker passage of the funding package to avoid government disruptions. Republicans launch their own demands At the same time, House Republicans, with some allies in the Senate, are making their own demands, as they work to support Trump\u2019s clampdown on immigrants in the U.S. The House Freedom Caucus has insisted on fuller funding for Homeland Security while certain Republicans are pushing to include other measures, including the SAVE Act, a longshot Trump priority that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to participate in elections and vote. Johnson and GOP leaders said they would be talking with lawmakers to see what it will take to win over support. \u201cObviously the president really wants this,\u201d Majority Leader Steve Scalise said at the Capitol. \u201cWe always work \u2018til the midnight hour to get the votes,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cYou never start the process with everybody on board. You work through it.\u201d Workers without pay if partial government shutdown drags on Meanwhile, a number of federal agencies are snared in the funding standoff after the government went into a partial shutdown over the weekend. Defense, health, transportation and housing are among those that were given shutdown guidance by the administration, though many operations are deemed essential and services are not necessarily interrupted. Workers could go without pay if the impasse drags on. Some could be furloughed. Lawmakers from both parties are increasingly concerned the closure will disrupt the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which they rely on to help constituents after deadly snowstorms and other disasters. This is the second time in a matter of months that federal government operations have been disrupted as lawmakers use the annual funding process as leverage to extract policy changes. Last fall, Democrats sparked what became the longest federal shutdown in history, 43 days, as they protested the expiration of health insurance tax breaks. That shutdown ended with a promise to vote on proposals to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. But with GOP opposition, Democrats were unable to achieve their goal of keeping the subsidies in place. Insurance premiums spiked in the new year for millions of people. Trump tries to prevent another long shutdown Trump is already working on an immigration deal to ensure the shutdown doesn\u2019t drag on. Johnson said he was in the Oval Office last week when Trump, along with border czar Tom Homan, spoke with Schumer of New York as they discussed the immigration changes. Body cameras, which are already provided for in the package, and an end to the roving patrols by immigration agents are areas of potential agreement, Johnson said. But Johnson drew a line at other Democratic demands. He said he does not think that requiring immigration officers to remove their masks would have support from Republicans because it could lead to problems if their personal images and private information is posted online by protesters. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president would approve it \u2014 and he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Johnson said over the weekend on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d And Senate Majority Leader John Thune tapped the brakes on the demand from Democrats to require judicial warrants for officers\u2019 searches, saying it\u2019s likely to be a part of the negotiations ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to reach agreement in two weeks,\u201d Thune said at the Capitol. Democrats, however, said the immigration operations are out of control, and must end in Minneapolis and other cities. Growing numbers of lawmakers are also calling for Noem to be fired or impeached.

    "description": "Curt Cashour, the VA\u2019s assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs, will step into the top advisory role to VA Secretary Doug Collins.",
    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs will have a new chief of staff beginning mid-February following the departure of Chris Syrek, who has served in the position since January 2025. Army veteran and longtime Republican staffer Curt Cashour, who currently serves as the VA\u2019s assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs, will step into the top advisory role to VA Secretary Doug Collins. In a statement, Collins said Syrek\u2019s departure was planned, and with Cashour\u2019s appointment, he \u201clooks forward to many more VA improvements.\u201d \u201cChris has been a key part of our leadership team and my most trusted advisor since day one. He\u2019s done an amazing job helping us make the department work better and delivering on President Trump\u2019s promises to those who have worn the uniform,\u201d Collins said of Syrek, who served as VA deputy chief of staff from 2018 to 2021 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cWe thank Chris for his dedicated service and wish him the best in his future endeavors. We welcome Curt into his new role and look forward to many more VA improvements under the leadership of President Trump,\u201d Collins said. According to the VA announcement, Syrek is leaving the department for a position in the private sector. He previously served as head of federal consulting at KPMG and a lobbyist for a trucking association. Cashour has spent his career in public affairs, starting with a four-year stint in the U.S. Army followed by nearly a decade in private and public service, including two separate periods as communications director for House Veterans Affairs Committee Republicans. Cashour is an Iraq War veteran who earned the Bronze Star and has a Combat Action Badge From 2017 to 2021, Cashour was the VA\u2019s press secretary and later, the deputy assistant secretary for public affairs. During that time, he and John Ullyot, then the VA\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs, were implicated in the departure of VA Secretary David Shulkin, who left the VA amid a controversy over travel expenses. USA Today reported in 2018 that Ullyot and Cashour campaigned for the ouster of Shulkin, who was appointed VA secretary by President Barack Obama and was retained by Trump. In response to the article and additional reports by the Washington Post on the pair\u2019s alleged role in Shulkin\u2019s removal, they issued a statement saying it never happened. \u201cThe allegation is ridiculous,\u201d they wrote. The VA currently has all but one of its six top leadership roles filled. A search is underway to fill the open position of undersecretary for benefits , which oversees the delivery of disability compensation, education, housing and other benefits for more than 6 million veterans. Principal Deputy Undersecretary for Benefits Michael Frueh is currently serving in the role as a commission, led by Deputy VA Secretary Paul Lawrence, conducts the process for recommending candidates to the president. The previous nominee, Karen Brazell, a senior adviser to VA Secretary Doug Collins, withdrew her nomination in October for personal reasons.",

    "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs has returned to a pre-2022 policy that requires patients seeking the procedure to go outside the department for care.",
    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs has ended nearly all abortions at VA facilities, returning to a pre-2022 policy that requires patients seeking the procedure to go outside the department for care. The VA issued a final rule Dec. 31 that prohibits the procedure at VA medical facilities unless the life of the mother is endangered. The decision ends a policy implemented in September 2022 that allowed VA medical personnel to conduct abortions in cases of rape or incest or circumstances that endangered the life or health of the patient. The policy was instituted shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, landmark legislation that legalized abortions nationwide. Since the decision, 25 states have outlawed or restricted abortion services, leading federal medical providers to consider their role in providing abortion services to their beneficiaries. The VA issued an interim rule in August that effectively halted all abortion procedures at VA medical facilities. Democrat lawmakers drew attention to the final rule last week, however, by introducing a resolution to overturn the rule. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and other congressional Democrats have sponsored a resolution seeking to overturn the rule. During a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday, Murray and Sen. Maisie Hirono, D-Hawaii., questioned VA Secretary Doug Collins on the change, decrying a policy that limits a medical procedure for 460,000 women veterans of reproductive age. \u201cVA providers are not even allowed to discuss abortion as an option with veteran patients,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI just want everyone to know that, under this VA final rule, no exceptions for rape or for incest. And I find that outrageous.\u201d Collins pushed back, noting that in medical emergencies where the life of a mother is endangered, the patient would still have access to the procedure. He added that the policy is simply a return to the VA\u2019s regulations before 2022 under administrations of Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Murray said when former VA Secretary Denis McDonough introduced the policy allowing for abortions, he \u201crightfully [made] sure if someone was raped or a victim of incest, they could get health care.\u201d \u201cWe probably see it differently,\u201d Collins responded. The previous regulation also allowed abortion coverage for patients in the VA\u2019s Civilian Health and Medical Program, or CHAMPVA, the program that provides medical care for eligible spouses and dependents of veterans. The new policy prohibits CHAMPVA coverage of abortions. Between September 2022 and August 2025, the VA had covered or provided abortions to roughly 100 veterans and 40 CHAMPVA patients, according to data provided by the VA. Last September, after the VA published its interim rule reversing the policy, Republican lawmakers praised the move, writing Collins in support of the decision. In a letter signed by 72 representatives and senators, they said the VA had erred in giving access to the procedure on the basis of a pregnancy jeopardizing a veteran\u2019s health. \u201cWithout a narrower definition or gestational limit for this health exception, the VA has been promoting abortion on demand, at any point during pregnancy, so long as the mother-patient is able to secure a medical professional\u2019s opinion that having an abortion would be \u2018beneficial\u2019 to her health in any way,\u201d they wrote.",

    "description": "The reorganization of the VA health system should result in improvements to medical facilities, increased oversight and better access, officials said.",
    "content": "The planned reorganization of the Veterans Affairs health system should result in improvements to VA medical facilities, increased oversight of hospitals and clinics and better access to care at the VA and with civilian providers in the department\u2019s community networks, VA officials said during appearances before Congress this month. In what will be the largest reorganization of the Veterans Health Administration since the 1990s, the VA plans to restructure VHA\u2019s administration, realign staff and resources and invest in medical facilities . At the same time, the VA will award new contracts for community care \u2014 its program that covers medical care for eligible veterans at civilian facilities \u2014 using a new structure the VA hopes will give the department better flexibility to choose and change contracted provider networks. According to VA Secretary Doug Collins, the restructuring will \u201celiminate the glut of VA administrative overhead\u201d and put more resources directly into VA facilities and community care. Collins said in his first year of office, he has toured VA medical facilities and found significant differences in delivery of health care. \u201cWe didn\u2019t act like the largest healthcare provider in the world in many ways because we were trapped internally into our own policies, procedures, things that have been added on \u2014 none which added up to taking care of veterans but ended up taking care of the VA itself,\u201d Collins told members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Under the reorganization, known as the Restructure for Impact and Sustainability Effort, or RISE initiative, the VA will decrease the number of Veterans Integrated Service Networks, or VISNs, which provide oversight, administrative, budgetary services and support to VA medical centers, from 18 to 5, with the VISNs focused namely on oversight and governance. The reforms will create health service areas, or HSAs, within the VISNs to focus on medical centers and the communities where veterans get their health services. And they will create a medical operations center that will ensure that policies are implemented and followed throughout the system. Regarding the community care program, the VA issued a call for contract proposals earlier this month to provide medical services, agreements worth nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The Community Care Network Next Generation contract, with its indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity structure, is meant to give the department more flexibility in overseeing the program, currently managed by two health contractors, Optum and TriWest Healthcare Alliance. According to VA Chief Financial Officer Richard Topping, the new contracts will ensure that network providers will \u201ccompete and improve continually\u201d to serve veterans. \u201cThe government will have the ability to bring on multiple vendors and multiple contractors,\u201d Topping said during a hearing before the House Veterans Affairs Committee Jan. 22. \u201cThose contractors can then compete across the life of the contract for different task orders. That allows VA to change program design to learn from mistakes, to increase our capabilities and capacities to innovate and evolve the program over time.\u201d Veterans advocates and congressional Democrats have raised concerns that any reductions in personnel related to restructuring or expanded contracts for community care will erode the VA\u2019s medical system and lead to privatization of VA health care. \u201cWhile veterans are going to go unserved and uncared for in his actions, we see exactly who Secretary Collins really serves, driving the VA towards privatization,\u201d said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., during the House hearing. \u201cWe know it only serves corporate interests, and it puts profits over veterans.\u201d But VA officials have said that the restructuring will streamline the administration and provide better services to veterans. Topping noted that while the community care contracts are worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the VA plans to spend $2 trillion for care in its own facilities during the same time frame. \u201cWe\u2019re opening new facilities. We\u2019ve invested $800 million last year alone. We are investing in our direct care capabilities. And so, for veterans who either need to go to VA for direct care because it\u2019s a unique capability that VA has, or who choose to go, they have that ability, and they have that choice,\u201d Topping said. The VA has lost 30,000 personnel in the past year as a result of resignations, retirements and attrition, as well as plans for an additional reduction of 24,000 jobs, which officials say were mainly positions created during the COVID-19 pandemic that are no longer required and have been vacant for at least a year. Collins said the reorganization will allow the department to shift staff where they are needed and trim excess at underutilized locations. He added that the effort is moving forward with VA leadership taking into account input from staff, Congress and others. \u201cThis is not an effort to diminish direct care for veterans. This is a reorganization that will eliminate the glut of VA administrative overhead and push more resources directly into the field,\u201d Collins said. The VA announced Wednesday it will spend $4.8 billion this year to make repairs and modernize numerous health care facilities, including upgrades to elevators, electrical and climate control systems and improvements to help accommodate the rollout of the department\u2019s electronic health record system. Republican and Democrat lawmakers alike promised close scrutiny of the VA reforms over the coming months, with the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee planning another hearing on the modernization efforts and House members saying their hearing on Jan. 22 was \u201conly the beginning\u201d of oversight. \u201cIt should go without saying that VA must get this right. When veterans call my committee, they want to know how they can access their earned health benefits at VA,\u201d House Veterans Affairs Committee Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., said. Proposals for the new community care contract are due to the government in March.",

    "description": "Crytpo scams, romance scams, education scams, job scams. Advocates are pushing authorities to root out scamsters at the source.",
    "content": "Attempts to defraud service members, veterans and their families are so rampant that advocates are pushing for an entirely new approach to cracking down on predators and root causes, according to a recent congressional roundtable. In an increasingly digital world in which it is easy to mask identity, lawmakers should ensure federal agencies \u201cdon\u2019t have a monopoly on enforcement,\u201d Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2021 to 2025, said during the Jan. 21 House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Democrats discussion. \u201cWe should be rethinking our enforcement strategy and policy approach,\u201d added Chopra. That might mean amending laws to give state attorneys general more enforcement authority in protecting troops and veterans, he said, and in many cases give private citizens the ability to pursue legal action. The staff at CFPB has been \u201cobliterated\u201d over the last year with the change in administrations, said Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee. \u201cWe went through this whole thing with [the Department of Government Efficiency] to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Takano said. \u201cBut there\u2019s tremendous fraud being perpetrated, and we\u2019re not equipping our government to protect American citizens.\u201d A federal judge in December blocked the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to defund the CFPB. Since its opening in 2011, it has returned $21 billion to consumers, according to Chopra. In 2024, meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission received about 210,000 consumer fraud complaints from troops and their families, with losses totaling nearly $600 million. Chopra said the CFPB and the FTC haven\u2019t brought a single enforcement action over the past year related to violations of the Military Lending Act , or abuses in the Veterans Affairs mortgage program or G.I. Bill. Among other things, the Military Lending Act puts a 36% cap on many consumer loan interest rates for active duty troops and their families. \u201cCFPB and the FTC have to be fully funded and staffed and doing their job,\u201d said Jeremy Villanueva, associate legislative director of Paralyzed Veterans of America. \u201cBy the time a law comes out, people have already been victimized. CFPB is supposed to be out there ahead of that.\u201d Professional scammers are reactionary, Villanueva added, and will quickly find a way around new laws and regulations. Officials at the CFPB and FTC did not respond to a request for comment as of publication. The VA Office of Inspector General investigates fraud schemes that damage VA programs and diminish services provided to veterans, caregivers and survivors, David Case, VA deputy inspector general, said during the roundtable. In fiscal 2025, their investigators pursued 150 criminal fraud cases, he added. While job scams target anyone, military spouses may be especially vulnerable because of frequent moves, said Ally Armeson, executive director of Cybercrime Support Network. \u201cYou become desperate, you\u2019re looking for any job. ... You fall into a job scam.\u201d Suddenly, there\u2019s no job, and the spouse has paid money or lost information to a scammer, added Amerson, a veteran and military spouse. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging ... to build a career as a military spouse and to find a profession that\u2019s compatible with the military lifestyle,\u201d said Eileen Huck, director of government relations for the National Military Family Association. Huck added that some spouses are reeled in to multi-level marketing jobs, which may operate as illegal pyramid schemes. She also cited some used car dealers as entities that prey on young troops. \u201cThey\u2019re paying thousands on a credit card they\u2019re not prepared for,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t always have the financial expertise or knowledge before taking on obligations.\u201d Identity theft, romance scams, education scams, crypto scams and disability claims scams are among the many schemes that target the military community, advocates told lawmakers. Armeson said her organization has a recovery group that attempts to help victims who have lost money, but restitution \u2014 if any \u2014 can take years, and victims only get back a fraction of what they lost. The median amount victims have lost in crypto scams is $230,000, she said, citing organizational data. For romance scams, that number is $130,000. In the veteran community, meanwhile, select schools often make false promises to secure troops\u2019 guaranteed GI Bill money, said Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy at Veterans Education Success. Seven of the top 10 schools with the highest GI Bill money accrual have experienced high volumes of student complaints, he said, and even faced state law enforcement actions. \u201cThis is a systemic issue. We need to hit the root cause,\u201d Hubbard said. Tech companies should also be regulated, held accountable and forced to warn people about scams, said Gretchen Peters, founder and executive director of Alliance to Counter Crime Online. Some social media platforms are able to detect individual scammers within about two weeks of setting up a new account, she added. Chopra said it has become easy to extract personal information about troops with social media and other platforms. Data brokers also sell information about the military community to scammers, he added. This enables them to figure out \u201cwho is really looking for romance, who is looking for a car, who is actually in financial distress,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "The Pentagon has stood up a new operation to focus solely on permanent fixes for the decades-old problems of damaged and lost household goods encountered by service members and families moving to new duty stations. With military moving season just around the corner, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced the establishment of the Personal Property Activity, elevating the importance of oversight of military household goods moves as a key mission. In a Jan. 21 memorandum, he stated the PPA will report to him through the under secretary for acquisition and sustainment. The new group\u2019s mission will be to \u201cguarantee high quality, reliable and efficient household goods and vehicle shipment services for the more-than-300,000 warfighters worldwide who move somewhere every year,\u201d Hegseth said. If there are failures in the process, \u201cour job is to correct it and make it right, not deny that it happened,\u201d he added. For decades, military families have experienced problems with missed pickups and deliveries, broken and lost household goods and a cumbersome claims process. In his video, Hegseth described examples of dressers missing a leg, couches looking like they had been dragged down the street and a service member\u2019s family\u2019s belongings that were packed upside down in boxes, spilling out and getting crushed. \u201cWe listened to the concerns of our warriors,\u201d Hegseth said. Hegseth fired the director of the personal property program last summer, and directed the formation of a task force to find solutions. That task force is headed by Army Maj. Gen. Lance Curtis. Hegseth also named Curtis as the PPA\u2019s first commander. \u201cWhen our warfighters are worried about their household goods, they aren\u2019t focused on their mission,\u201d Curtis said in an announcement of the reform. \u201cWe are ending that distraction. Mission readiness is non-negotiable.\u201d Over more than 30 years, defense officials have made several attempts to reform and improve the government\u2019s handling of the household goods move process. The most recent was a massive effort to privatize the management of the moves under the $6.2 billion Global Household Goods Contract. DOD terminated the contract in June, citing inadequacies by the contractor, HomeSafe Alliance. Hegseth\u2019s designation of PPA as a special activity removes the responsibility and oversight of the personal property program from the U.S. Transportation Command. Here are some of the changes the task force has already implemented, according to PPA spokesman Army Maj. Matthew Visser: This year, service members moving during peak moving season \u2014 generally May to September \u2014 can start booking moves March 20 (if they have orders to move), one month earlier than booking started in previous years. There have been increases in per diem paid when a family is inconvenienced because of a mover\u2019s delays. In addition to the service member, per diem is allowed for dependents \u2014 up to 75% of what meals and incidentals would be. The inconvenience claims are paid by the moving company. Personal property business rules have been updated to provide more competitive compensation for industry. After listening to movers\u2019 concerns about lack of competitive rates, the task force identified this issue as a limiting factor in getting the best movers. A call center has been established for troops and families to communicate directly. End to end The PPA will oversee the personal property process end to end \u2014 from the time the service member books a shipment to the claims process, if required \u2014 Hegseth said. The new group will also have capabilities that commands have, such as acquisition, legal and resource management. \u201cThis is enduring,\u201d said Visser. \u201cNo longer will the Defense Personal Property Program not receive the attention and oversight that\u2019s needed. There will be a commander who will be responsive and responsible for the program.\u201d PPA will be headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, and there will be a \u201csmall growth\u201d in the number of personnel, Visser said. Hegseth directed that PPA be established by May 1 and fully operational within one year. The task force will continue to issue guidance for the Defense Personal Property Program until the PPA reaches initial operational capability, according to Hegseth\u2019s memo. The military services\u2019 shipping offices will remain on installations, helping service members with their moves, but they will report to and be accountable to the PPA, instead of the individual service branch, Visser added. Movers for America, a coalition of companies, moving professionals and independent owner-operators that move military families, issued a statement applauding Hegseth for \u201ctaking decisive action to fix the military\u2019s Permanent Change of Station system and for elevating this mission to the highest levels of leadership within the Department of Defense.\u201d \u201cTreating military moves as a priority and placing direct responsibility under the secretary sends a clear message that the readiness of service members and their families matters to America\u2019s national security,\u201d the group said.",

    "description": "Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was an intensive care nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs, his family said.",
    "content": "Family members say the man killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday was an intensive care nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital who cared deeply about people and was upset by President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in his city. Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed getting in adventures with Joule, his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog who recently died. He had participated in protests following the killing of Renee Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs officer on Jan. 7. \u201cHe cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,\u201d said Michael Pretti, Alex\u2019s father. \u201cHe thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests.\u201d Pretti was a U.S. citizen, born in Illinois. Like Good, court records showed he had no criminal record and his family said he had never had any interactions with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. In a recent conversation with their son, his parents, who live in Colorado, told him to be careful when protesting. \u201cWe had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that... go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\u201d Michael Pretti said. \u201cAnd he said he knows that. He knew that.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security said that the man was shot after he \u201capproached\u201d Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Officials did not specify if Pretti brandished the gun. In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon. Family members said Pretti owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota. They said they had never known him to carry it. Alex Pretti\u2019s family struggles for information about what happened The family first learned of the shooting when they were called by an Associated Press reporter. They watched the video and said the man killed appeared to be their son. They then tried reaching out to officials in Minnesota. \u201cI can\u2019t get any information from anybody,\u201d Michael Pretti said Saturday. \u201cThe police, they said call Border Patrol, Border Patrol\u2019s closed, the hospitals won\u2019t answer any questions.\u201d Eventually, the family called the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, who they said confirmed had a body matching the name and description of their son. Alex Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. After graduation, he went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology, society and the environment, according to the family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse. Alex Pretti had protested before Pretti\u2019s ex-wife, Rachel N. Canoun, said she was not surprised he would have been involved in protesting Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. She said she had not spoken to him since they divorced more than two years ago and she moved to another state. She said he was a Democratic voter and that he had participated in the wave of street protests following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, not far from the couple\u2019s neighborhood. She described him a someone who might shout at law enforcement officers at a protest, but she had never known him to be physically confrontational. \u201cThese kinds of things, you know, he felt the injustice to it,\u201d Canoun said. \u201cSo, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that he would be involved.\u201d Canoun said Pretti got a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years ago and that he owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated. \u201cHe didn\u2019t carry it around me, because it made me uncomfortable,\u201d she said. Pretti had \u2018a great heart\u2019 Pretti lived in a four-unit condominium building about 2 miles from where he was shot. Neighbors described him as quiet and warmhearted. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful person,\u201d said Sue Gitar, who lived downstairs from Pretti and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \u201cHe has a great heart.\u201d If there was something suspicious going on in the neighborhood, or when they worried the building might have a gas leak, he would jump in to help. Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbors said, and would sometimes have friends over. His neighbors knew he had guns \u2014 he\u2019d occasionally take a rifle to shoot at a gun range \u2014 but were surprised at the idea that he might carry a pistol on the streets. \u201cI never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\u201d said Gitar. Pretti was also passionate about the outdoors A competitive bicycle racer who lavished care on his new Audi, Pretti had also been deeply attached to his dog, who died about a year ago. His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple days before his death. They talked about repairs he had done to the garage door of his home. The worker was a Latino man, and they said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 tip. Pretti\u2019s mother said her son cared immensely about the direction the county was headed, especially the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of environmental regulations . \u201cHe hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\u201d Susan Pretti said. \u201cHe was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\u201d",

    "description": "AI's ability to monitor a warfighter\u2019s mental state, visuals or inner dialog may outpace the ability to shield that data from misuse, some scientists say.",
    "content": "Neurable , a consumer neurotechnology startup, has partnered with the Air Force to study whether electrode-studded headphones can track service members\u2019 cognitive fitness, much like Garmin smartwatches have monitored Space Force members\u2019 physical fitness , company and government officials said this month. The $1.2 million project adds to the Pentagon\u2019s growing investment in the $3 billion market for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) \u2014 helmets, earbuds, other wearable devices and medical implants that use artificial intelligence to make sense of brain signals. Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink , perhaps the most high-profile implantable example, has enabled clinical trial patients who cannot move or speak to type words that they imagine. Since at least the 1970s , the Defense Department has funded the development of BCIs that, among other things, restore eyesight and control prosthetic arms . Now, advances in AI enable BCIs to interpret or change brain activity with unprecedented accuracy and speed. So much so that some scientists and neuroethicists say the capacity to monitor signals that reveal a warfighter\u2019s or a veteran\u2019s mental states , visual perceptions or inner dialogue may outpace the ability to shield that data from misuse. \u201cOne could certainly imagine how enforced use of such devices could create a very dystopian basis for behavioral control,\u201d warned James Giordano, director of the National Defense University\u2019s Center for Disruptive Technology and Future Warfare and Georgetown University Medical Center\u2019s former chief of neuroethics studies. Consequently, any accessing or use of neural data must require \u201congoing, active informed consent,\u201d so active and retired military have the chance to opt in or out without penalty, he said. Giordano, who was sharing his personal views and not speaking on behalf of any government agency, added, \u201cThe security of the neurological data used for that individual \u2014 and in that individual\u2019s wellbeing only \u2014 is paramount. It goes beyond simple HIPAA.\u201d He was referring to the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a law regulating healthcare providers that predates global Wi-Fi and does not cover most app and algorithm developers, commercial cloud providers or consumer wearable designers. Neurable and Air Force officials say that the non-invasive cognitive fitness tracker will build upon technology in the firm\u2019s consumer BCI product \u2014 Master & Dynamic luxury headphones containing fabric electroencephalogram, or EEG, sensors and electrically conductive inks to gauge mental focus. The $500 device, which launched last June, deploys an algorithm that maps brainwaves to ground-truth markers of focus \u2014 users\u2019 speed and accuracy in finishing tasks, while undistracted and distracted. When the wearer\u2019s brainwaves resemble those tied to flagging attention, the headphones sync with an app that alerts the user: \u201cYou\u2019ve earned a Brain Break.\u201d The Air Force-funded BCI project will use other headset models, such as noise protectors or helmets, said Neurable co-founder Adam Molnar, who helped secure $4 million for prior military research and development work. The study will measure cognitive performance with and without pressure \u2014 for instance, memory skill with and without sleep deprivation \u2014 against brainwaves to identify brain activity associated with optimal and suboptimal performance, according to Neurable. The idea is that alerting service members to significant brain signal changes throughout the day \u2014 or, providing \u201cneurofeedback\u201d \u2014 will train them to adjust their behavior and brainwaves to hit peak performance. \u201cThis is all within this concept of readiness. How do we make sure that we have a ready and able defense?\u201d said Molnar, who anticipates wrapping development within two years. Molnar added that the Space Force has a \u201c really cool program where they\u2019re using the Garmin watch ,\u201d embedded with heart rate, blood oxygen and other wrist-worn sensors, \u201cto help improve cardio fitness and physical activity \u201a\u201d but \u201cwe don\u2019t really have that for the brain.\u201d A comparable neurofeedback tool, he said, may spur \u201cmore robust brain health practices, not just for defense, but also for possibly identifying Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s disease indicators a decade before you feel your first symptom.\u201d Air Force Research Laboratory officials said that Neurable\u2019s fabric-based sensing technology may aid multiple operations, inside and outside of the cockpit. \u201cI suspect that there are a large number of military members for whom a real-time fatigue or cognitive state monitor would be appealing if they thought it would make them more effective at executing the mission,\u201d William Aue, cognitive neuroscience section chief at the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s 711th Human Performance Wing , said by email. Let them \u2018make their mind up\u2019 Some neuroethicists, however, cautioned that the use of brain wearables may also invade troops\u2019 privacy and foster prejudice. \u201cWe need to be much more reflective on, much more concerned about and much more focused on the implications of altering a person\u2019s brainwaves,\u201d through neurofeedback training, \u201cas compared to having them work out more or do more pull-ups,\u201d said Jared Genser, a lawyer and co-founder of the Neurorights Foundation, a group advocating for the legal protection of people\u2019s brain data. Similarly, Giordano said, \u201cThe concept of personalized medicine must be applied here,\u201d meaning that military leaders must tailor training and performance metrics to the limits of each individual\u2019s brain and body, so \u201cthat you don\u2019t get plateaus, and you\u2019re not beginning to see performance decrement or performance fatigue.\u201d The Neurorights Foundation\u2019s Medical Director Sean Pauzauskie, a neurologist in the UCHealth University of Colorado system, added that cognitive fitness standards may overstep the proposed right to freedom from algorithmic bias based on neural data interpretations . \u201cIf the warfighter\u2019s brain is incapable of the appropriate plasticity to achieve the desired [mental] state,\u201d through neurofeedback training, \u201cthey could be discriminated\u201d against by their superiors, Pauzauskie said. Also, EEG data flowing into and out of consumer wearables can reveal several diseases, including epilepsy and mild cognitive impairment , as well as a range of emotions . Via email, Molnar responded to such concerns, saying, \u201cNeurable\u2019s focus is on supporting human performance and safety, not enforcing neurological conformity.\u201d \u201cAny feedback provided by our systems is designed to be informational and user-centered, helping individuals understand factors like cognitive workload or fatigue,\u201d he added, \u201cmuch like a heart-rate monitor provides insight into physical exertion.\u201d Neurable officials said the system\u2019s sensors filter out all EEG data not needed by its algorithms and encrypt the limited amount of necessary data in transit. \u201cEven if someone hacked someone\u2019s brain data, they would not be able to make sense of it,\u201d Molnar said. The Air Force\u2019s Aue confirmed that, during experiments, the Air Force lab anonymizes EEG data streaming from Neurable\u2019s wearables, adding that the information is \u201cchallenging to interpret without the algorithms we use to process the raw data.\u201d But, such protections may not stop adversaries from decoding wearable-based intelligence in the future, as AI becomes smarter and devices utilize more EEG data. Already, in the laboratory , algorithms can narrow down a person\u2019s identity into a \u201cmindprint\u201d of their mental processing or \u201cbrainprint\u201d of their brain structures, based on EEG data from a medical headcap, Pauzauskie noted. Likewise, Genser explained, EEG data that is out into the open, if isolated from a person\u2019s name and identity, will remain deidentified but only for a period. The problem is that, as generative AI-powered software develops, \u201cyou are going to be able to decode a lot more information from the data that escaped, enabling the data to be reidentified and traced back to you personally.\u201d In an email, Molnar acknowledged that as \u201cAI continues to accelerate research and development, it is prudent to anticipate how capabilities might evolve and to establish safeguards early.\u201d He suggested additional ethical review, clear boundaries on acceptable uses, and dialogue across technologists, ethicists, policymakers and technology users. Aue, who has been working on other research with Neurable for four years, said in an email that research study participants \u201care fully informed about the nature of the work before participating.\u201d That said, as the technology matures, conversations \u201cneed to occur about the ethical use of the technology and what military doctrine might entail,\u201d he added. Giordano said that the key to any adoption of AI-based neurotech in the military is mandatory informed consent during and after service. Personnel must receive updates on any adverse effects and information on \u201cthe availability or non-availability of continuity of care if things go wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cThat way, they can make their mind up.\u201d Reading the minds of wounded warriors? Due to AI, implantable brain devices, much as non-invasive brain wearables, now offer troops and veterans novel insights into themselves \u2014 and possibly the same intel to adversaries, too. For instance, new eyesight neuroprostheses rely on AI to \u201cbridge artificial vision and neural tissue,\u201d said Christopher Steele, chief of strategy at the Pentagon-backed nonprofit Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium. The consortium provided $2 million to help develop a prototype. The camera-equipped BCI uses AI to decode brain signals that convey the landscape a person\u2019s eyes are trying to see. AI then translates data from the camera and other external sensors focused on that view into artificial signals that the mind understands as shapes and motion. Finally, AI compares the desired and perceived scenes and adjusts the artificial signals to show more detail, said Steele, a former director of the Army Medical Research and Development Command. This self-adjusting AI, while a potential breakthrough for visually-impaired warfighters, also introduces risks, Giordano said. \u201cThe AI that provides continuous closed-loop signals between the eye and the brain is not monitored,\u201d he explained. As such, it may self-adapt in a way that falsifies images, omits certain elements of the view or delays transmission of an image, any of which may result in a loss of situational awareness, Giordano said. Compounding the problem, when the AI \u201csystem itself is vulnerable to hacking,\u201d an adversary can monitor or corrupt the warfighter\u2019s visual input, he added. \u201cIf we deploy this device downrange\u201d in a combat zone, \u201dcan it be hacked by an enemy?\" Steele said. \u201cWe are concerned about the hacking of any medical capability.\u201d Currently, the system only operates in clinical trials that are subject to HIPAA, and other protections include hardware isolation, encryption and AI guardrails that prevent unsafe adaptation, he added. Yet, as Giordano cautioned, self-learning AI, by design, can learn good or bad behavior that may override guardrails. Another military funding arm, the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Research Program , is underwriting clinical trials to evaluate Braingate , a forerunner to Musk\u2019s Neuralink implant that translates words a patient imagines into audible speech. The Defense Department\u2019s $2.3 million contribution aims to help people with ALS \u2014 a disease associated with military service \u2014 who cannot move or talk. This advance is \u201cfoundationally fantastic\u201d for people with various neuro-motor conditions who can think of speech but not generate motor output to move their mouths, meaning \u201cthey\u2019re communicatively locked in,\u201d Giordano said. The device \u201callows these individuals the autonomy of communication.\u201d At the same time, because the device reads signals in the motor cortex that show attempts at moving the mouth, the tool allows for \u201cwhat might be regarded as mind-reading,\u201d Giordano said. Currently, human beings, military or not, have no legal right to be free of mind-reading. Neither international human rights law nor federal regulations safeguard mental privacy, mental autonomy (\u201cfree will\u201d) or neural data, according to the Neurorights Foundation. Only four states \u2014 California , Colorado , Connecticut and Montana afford protection to \u201cneural data\u201d within their state consumer data privacy laws. And one country, Chile, has adopted a constitutional amendment to protect \u201cmental integrity.\u201d As the Foundation\u2019s Genser notes, one of the only countries with a national-level set of principles on the ethical use of BCIs, China, may be the least likely to use it . He is pressing for \u201cclear limits\u201d on the purposes for developing and using neurotech and neural data in the military, subject to strong oversight that safeguards the health and autonomy of service members. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have any tools or standards around the national security implications of emerging neurotechnologies, then how is our military different than any other military?\u201d Genser posited. As an illustration of unregulated brain alteration, he pointed to the CIA\u2019s MKUltra program, a Cold War-era mind-control experiment that tested LSD and other psychedelic drugs on soldiers and others, sometimes with permanent psychological and physical harm . \u201cThe last thing we want is for neurotech to be the next version of MKUltra,\u201d Genser said, \u201cnot using drugs, but using neuro-stimulation or other neural approaches to alter brain activity.\u201d Aliya Sternstein is an investigative journalist who covers technology, cognition and national security. She is also a research analyst at Georgetown Law. Her writing on the intersection of public health and constitutional rights has appeared in the Stanford Law Review, Arizona Law Review, and other law and health academic journals.",

    "description": "The announcement follows several prominent cases of Army doctors taking indecent liberties with patients behind closed doors.",
    "content": "The Defense Health Agency has clarified the U.S. military\u2019s policy regarding chaperones during medical exams following several prominent cases of Army doctors taking indecent liberties with patients behind closed doors. In a memo sent last month to military health system leadership , including military hospitals and dental facilities and support offices, acting DHA Director David Smith said patients have always had a right to a chaperone, but physicians now must offer them for sensitive medical exams or procedures. Signage will inform patients that they have a right to a chaperone regardless of treatment, according to the memo, but in gynecological, breast or pelvic exams, they must be offered one. \u201cHaving chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,\u201d said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA\u2019s chief medical officer, in a statement released Thursday. \u201cChaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.\u201d Last January, former Army physician Maj. Michael Stockin was sentenced to nearly 14 years in prison for sexually abusing patients at Madigan Army Medical Center , Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. Stockin had pleaded guilty to 41 violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to include abusive sexual contact and indecent viewing with male patients under the auspices of medical exams. In November, patients of Army Maj. Blaine McGraw, an OB-GYN at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Texas, filed a lawsuit against him alleging that he had secretly recorded and sexually exploited them during breast and pelvic exams. McGraw was charged in December with 54 counts of indecent visual recording, five counts of conduct unbecoming an officer and other charges. He is in pre-trial confinement awaiting court proceedings. The American Medical Association recommends that physicians ensure that their patients are aware that chaperones are available on request and that doctors should always honor a patient\u2019s request to have a chaperone \u2014 one that is an authorized member of the health care team. Having a chaperone present, especially during sensitive exams, provides reassurance to the patients and \u201cdemonstrates an attention to the patients\u2019 well-being,\u201d according to the association\u2019s code of ethics. It also is helpful for the \u201cmore pragmatic goal of legal protection for the physician,\u201d according to association guidance. Under the new DOD policy, chaperones are available to serve as a safeguard for patients and staff and are members of the medical team who will maintain privacy but also would report any suspected inappropriate conduct. The guidelines call for staff to try to provide a chaperone of a certain sex if requested and if one is not available, the exam can be rescheduled. If a patient declines a chaperone, the medical staff must document the request but also can decline to conduct an exam if it is sensitive in nature. Personnel who may serve as chaperones include physicians, dentists, physician assistants, psychologists, social workers, nurses, medics and corpsmen, medical technicians and support assistants, medical residences and hospital volunteers. Non-medical personnel such as sexual assault response coordinators, victim advocates or family advocacy personnel may be in a room at the request of a patient in the event of a violence-related exam but they will not count as chaperones, according to the new policy. Regarding pediatric care, a chaperone is not required for normal checkups for children if a parent or guardian is in the room, but health care staff must offer a chaperone if an exam or procedure is beyond routine. For adolescents ages 11-17, the policy will follow the guidance for adult chaperones. \u201cThis system-wide chaperone policy is just one part of DHA\u2019s broader commitment to protect all patients and maintain the highest standards of professionalism,\u201d officials said regarding the new policy.",

    "description": "The VA has relaunched efforts to find a new head of veterans benefits following the withdrawal of nominee Karen Brazell last October.",
    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs has relaunched efforts to find a new head of veterans benefits following the withdrawal of nominee Karen Brazell last October. The VA has formally convened a commission led by Deputy Secretary Paul Lawrence to vet candidates for the position. Unlike most political appointments across the federal government, the undersecretaries of benefits and health must be recommended by a panel that includes advocates, industry representatives and previous members of VA leadership before they are nominated by the president. Karen Brazell, a senior adviser to VA Secretary Doug Collins, was selected last June for the position, which is responsible for overseeing nearly $200 billion in benefits and aid to veterans and their dependents. During her confirmation hearing in September, Brazell \u2014 an Army veteran and military spouse who worked in the VA\u2019s office of enterprise integration during the first Trump administration \u2014 received support from Republicans on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. But from the start of her nomination process, Senate Democrats had voiced concern over her role as Collins\u2019 senior adviser during a period that saw the VA planning to shed roughly 70,000 jobs. At Brazell\u2019s confirmation, Democrats also pressed her for assurances that veterans benefits would not be reduced under her watch through methods previously advocated by conservatives such as eliminating payments to veterans rated 20% or less or providing disability compensation based on income calculations. In response to questions from ranking member Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Brazell said she would review operations across the Veterans Benefits Administration and would \u201cfollow the law.\u201d Brazell then withdrew her nomination in October \u201cfor personal reasons.\u201d Margarita Devlin, VBA\u2019s principal deputy undersecretary for benefits, is currently acting in the undersecretary\u2019s role. The VA last had a permanent undersecretary in January 2025, when Josh Jacobs, who held the post for nearly two years, resigned at the start of the new administration. Jacobs\u2019 nomination also was not without controversy. While he sailed through his confirmation hearing in February 2023, a key Republican senator, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, later threatened to block his nomination because he felt that Jacobs, who previously served as acting undersecretary of benefits, was evasive in answering Grassley\u2019s concerns over whistleblower complaints. He was confirmed in a 74-25 vote. According to the VA, the department has reduced the backlog of disability claims decisions \u2014 defined as filings 125 days and older \u2014 by 60% in the past year. VBA also housed nearly 52,000 homeless veterans in 2025, the highest number in seven years. The Senate confirmed Air Force Reserve Maj. Gen. John Bartrum, the VA\u2019s nominee for undersecretary for health, in December in a 53-43 vote. Bartrum served much of his Air Force career in medical administration. He served as a mobilization assistant to the Air and Space Force surgeon general and was assigned as deputy incident manager in emergency support functions for the COVID-19 epidemic. In his civilian capacity, he was a professional staff member of the House Appropriations Committee for more than eight years, working on labor, education and health issues, including infectious diseases such as Ebola.",

    "description": "A \u201cmodest implementation\u201d of DOW would cost taxpayers about $10 million, the report said. That figure could rise to $125 million if adopted more broadly.",
    "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War could cost taxpayers anywhere from $10 million to $125 million, according to an analysis released by the Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday. The 11-page report said a \u201cmodest implementation\u201d of the name change would cost about $10 million. But that figure could rise up to $125 million if the new moniker were adopted \u201cbroadly and rapidly\u201d across the department . The congressional office noted the estimate is \u201cuncertain\u201d because the Pentagon \u201chas not provided information\u201d about how it plans to carry out the executive order signed by President Donald Trump in September. At the time of the announcement, Trump declared the Department of War was a \u201cmuch more appropriate name, especially in light of where the world is right now .\u201d Trump went on to argue that the Department of Defense was too politically correct, and the Department of War \u201cjust sounded better,\u201d noting it would be a callback to the original name used during the two world wars. \u201cWe won the first world war, we won the second world war, we won everything before that and in between,\u201d Trump stated in the Oval Office in September. \u201cAnd then we decided to go woke and we changed the name to the Department of Defense.\u201d The executive order directed the federal government to adopt the Department of War as a secondary title. Since then, the Pentagon has often styled itself that way, though its legal name remains unchanged. A formal renaming would require congressional approval, which has not been granted. The White House, in a fact sheet , said the Pentagon may use the Department of War name in official correspondence, public communications, ceremonies and non-statutory documents within the executive branch. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), one of the two lawmakers who requested the report, cast the rebranding effort as \u201cperformative government at its worst.\u201d \u201cInstead of prioritizing bringing down the cost of groceries or health care, Trump and his cronies are focused on vanity projects like renaming the Department of Defense,\u201d Merkley said in a statement . \u201cThis move is performative government at its worst and does nothing to advance national security or help service members and their families.\u201d The Department of War, signed into law by President George Washington in 1789, stood for more than a century and a half as the central military authority in the United States. After World War II, President Harry S. Truman replaced it with the National Military Establishment, merging the War and Navy departments with the newly independent Air Force. Two years later, it was rechristened the Department of Defense. In September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said reverting to the Department of War in the modern era would signal \u201cmaximum lethality, not tepid legality; violent effect, not politically correct.\u201d",

    "description": "A planned overhaul of the Veterans Health Administration will improve veterans care, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said Monday.",
    "content": "A planned overhaul of the Veterans Health Administration will improve veterans care by creating a centralized system that better supports hospitals and clinics, which, in turn, will increase their focus on patients, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said Monday. The department released an overview in December of its plans to reduce the VHA\u2019s administrative footprint \u2014 to include eliminating roughly 26,000 open positions \u2014 with an aim to streamline what the administration calls an \u201coverburdensome and complex bureaucracy.\u201d Under the plan, the VHA will reduce administrative duplication, increase accountability and oversight and improve focus on patients, according to officials. Some lawmakers and veterans advocates say the cuts will further strain a system that lost 30,000 employees to early retirements and resignations last year, resulting in more patients heading to the private sector for medical care or facing longer wait times at the VA. But speaking to reporters at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, on Monday, Collins said the reorganization could result in improvements to services, with clinics and hospitals \u201con the front lines\u201d and everyone else in VHA supporting them. Citing the Baltimore facility as an example, Collins noted that the hospital downsized by roughly 200 people two years ago and saw wait times decrease and quality increase. \u201cThe issue is not how many people we have; it\u2019s how well we are using those people,\u201d Collins said, according to a recording of the press briefing reviewed by Military Times. According to Collins, details of the reorganization plans, including personnel changes, will be released in early February, with the changes expected to take at least 18 months. Some of the reforms spelled out in the broad documents include reducing the number of regional networks from 18 to five and reorganizing smaller district offices, eliminating several key administrative jobs and shifting program offices. VA officials said last month that they looked at national health care models and organizations at top health care systems to craft their plans. Members of National Nurses United held a rally Thursday in the Bronx to protest cuts at New York City\u2019s VA facilities \u2014 383 across four boroughs. The cuts, they said, would exacerbate \u201calready dire staffing shortages\u201d and could lead to a \u201cdrastic deterioration of veteran care.\u201d \u201cIt is absolutely gut wrenching to see this administration take their axes to the VA and brutally hack away at this world class institution, the only health care system in the country specifically designed to care for veterans and to address their unique needs,\u201d Sharda Fornnarino, a registered nurse and secretary of the VA division for National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, said in a statement. Collins said that the VA is striving to preserve provider positions and the jobs slated to be eliminated have been vacant for more than a year, with VA leadership and hospitals approving the reductions. \u201cThere is a safety valve for every hospital and clinic in this system. If they need somebody, they can hire somebody. There is nobody telling them not to,\u201d Collins said. Critics of the plans point out that while preserving doctor and provider positions is admirable, administrative roles play an important part in functioning, ensuring that clinicians can focus on patients without having to do support work. One hospital administrator told Military Times that after a manager moved to a different job in another state, a medical facility was left without a top administrator because the position left open by the transfer was eliminated. \u201cIt must be noted that a lot of these support positions are very important to the function of the VHA,\u201d said the administrator, who asked that their name and location not be used because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Veterans service organizations such as Paralyzed Veterans of America and Disabled American Veterans have expressed favor for reducing what they have called \u201cadministrative barriers\u201d to care and say they look forward to learning more about the reorganization. \u201cBased on the way this was briefed, if it works the way it is intended, it gives us hope that many of these administrative barriers \u2014 and there are many of them across VHA \u2014 will be knocked down,\u201d said Carl Blake, CEO of PVA. Referring to a mantra of the National Cemetery Administration, Collins said the VHA has to get it right. \u201cI love the saying [the NCA] has, and that is, they have \u2018one chance to get it right.\u2019 I think that should be the thing for all of us at the VA: We have that one chance to get it right,\u201d Collins said. Details of Collins\u2019s visit to the Baltimore VA were first reported by Politico Pro.",

    "description": "Hegseth announced that Grok will soon go live in DOD and that \u201call appropriate data\u201d from military IT systems would be available for \"AI exploitation.\"",
    "content": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military\u2019s data as possible into the developing technology . \u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas. The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent. Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \u201cmake all appropriate data\u201d from the military\u2019s IT systems available for \u201cAI exploitation.\u201d He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems. Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly. The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration. During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d He noted that the Pentagon possesses \u201ccombat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\u201d \u201cAI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we\u2019re going to make sure that it\u2019s there,\u201d Hegseth said. The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \u201cthat won\u2019t allow you to fight wars.\u201d Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \u201cwithout ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\u201d before adding that the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cAI will not be woke.\u201d Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "description": "Under the legislation, a TBI Innovation Grant Program would award up to $30 million in grants through 2028 to non-VA health care providers, among others.",
    "content": "Legislators in the House and Senate have introduced bills that would give veterans wider access to treatments for brain injuries at facilities outside the Department of Veterans Affairs. Reps. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., and Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., rolled out their proposed \u201cBeacon Act\u201d on Friday, aiming to foster partnerships with academic institutions and providers for treatment and finance research into alternative treatments for mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, or TBI. During a press conference in Washington, D.C. on Friday, Cole Lyle, the American Legion\u2019s veterans affairs and rehabilitation director, said the legislation is needed because current treatments, including medication, often fall short in alleviating symptoms. \u201cWe believe veterans deserve care that reflects the complexity of their comorbid injuries, where healing does not happen with a one-size-fits-all bottle \u2014 care that brings innovation, research, community partnerships and, above all, hope,\u201d Lyle said. From 2000 through June 2025, Defense Department personnel were diagnosed with nearly 497,000 mild to moderate TBIs, according to the department. The majority were treated at military hospitals or clinics, including the Defense Intrepid Network for TBI and Brain Health or the Department of Veterans Affairs, which maintains four polytrauma rehabilitation centers and 21 sites in a polytrauma network. Under the legislation, a TBI Innovation Grant Program would award up to $30 million in grants through 2028 to nonprofits, academic institutions and non-VA health care providers for treatment and recovery, suicide prevention, training and outreach. The bill\u2019s Independent Research Grant Program would provide $625,000 awards for pilot studies and $1.5 million grants for research on alternative therapies for TBI. Bergman and Elfreth say their bill would strengthen the VA\u2019s ability to treat TBI by expanding access to new treatments. \u201cThe men and women who served our country deserve access to the best care available, especially when it comes to invisible injuries like traumatic brain injury,\u201d said Bergman, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general. \u201cThe Beacon Act strengthens the VA\u2019s ability to deliver modern, effective care by bringing proven innovation, academic expertise, and community partnerships to the table, while supporting the important work the VA is already doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the granddaughter of a veteran who suffered from [post-traumatic stress disorder], I\u2019ve seen firsthand the complex mental health challenges that our veterans and their families face. I\u2019ve also seen how traditional VA treatments have come up short for decades to fully address the complex challenges our veterans face,\u201d said Elfreth. A similar bill was introduced last November in the Senate by Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick and Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen. Their bill, the Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Adaptive Care Opportunities Nationwide Act, also would promote partnerships and develop research through similar grant programs. \u201cAs I think about the soldiers I served alongside, I feel this issue deeply,\u201d said McCormick, a former Army officer. \u201cOur veterans deserve access to innovative and groundbreaking TBI treatments that will enhance their quality of life and finally address the suicide epidemic among servicemembers.\u201d The legislative proposals have the support of the American Legion, AMVETS, Avalon Action Alliance, With Honor, the Marcus Institute for Brain Health, University of Colorado Anschutz, Disabled American Veterans, America\u2019s Warrior Partnership, Boulder Crest Foundation, Mission Roll Call and Veterans of Foreign Wars. \u201cStudies and reporting show time and again a connection between service-related blast overpressure injuries and increased rates of suicide among service members and veterans,\u201d said Rye Barcott, Co-Founder and CEO of With Honor said in a statement. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation,\u201d he noted, \u201cbrings together government, academia, and the private sector to align and accelerate research and treatment for traumatic brain injuries to reduce the skyrocketing suicide rates among active-duty service members and veterans.\u201d",

    "description": "In fiscal 2025, the VA granted state veterans cemeteries across the country, including for the establishment of one in Alaska, over $77 million.",
    "content": "Certain state veterans cemeteries across the country received a near total of $80 million in grants in fiscal 2025 for their improvement from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, officials recently announced. The department granted 20 state veterans cemeteries over $77 million in fiscal 2025 for their improvement, expansion, reimbursements and the new establishment of one in Alaska, according to a VA statement released Dec. 30. \u201cUnder President Trump, VA is committed to ensuring America\u2019s Veterans cemeteries have the resources they need to provide excellent memorial benefits and services to our nation\u2019s Veterans and their families, and these grants underscore that fact,\u201d VA Secretary Doug Collins said in the release. The cemeteries awarded grants include cemeteries in Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as the establishment of the Interior Alaska Veterans Cemetery in Fairbanks. VA\u2019s National Cemetery Administration works to reimburse states for their state-run veterans cemeteries\u2019 building, improvement or expansion costs. The administered grants usually fund items such as improvements necessary for burials and operations and the construction of pre-placed crypts or columbaria, per the memo. In fiscal 2025, more than 43,705 veterans and eligible family members were interred in VA grant-funded cemeteries, making up roughly 25% of the 174,705 total annual interments in all national and VA grant-funded veterans cemeteries. The department has long strived to establish a veterans cemetery close to where almost every American veteran resides to improve burial options. Currently, just under 94% of veterans nationwide have \u201creasonable access\u201d to one, meaning about 77 million veterans live within 75 miles of a national, state or tribal veterans cemetery, according to the VA. Since 2023, VA officials have set the goal to 95%, but the task requires a mix of federal and local funding as well as a commitment from regional leaders for preservation of the cemeteries. The VA has awarded a total of over $1.1 billion in grants since 1980 to 124 veterans cemeteries in 47 states, 14 tribal nations and three territories, working in tandem with the VA\u2019s 157 national cemeteries to provide more access for veterans.",

Tricare open season Tuesday, Dec. 9: The Tricare open season ends at midnight Eastern Standard Time. Beneficiaries can make changes to their Tricare health care plan, such as switching from Tricare Prime to Tricare Select. Visit tricare.mil/openseason to compare costs and plans and enroll. Online enrollment is also available through the Beneficiary Web Enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil . If beneficiaries don\u2019t make changes now, the next chance is open season next year or a qualifying life event such as a birth. This open season also includes a new option for beneficiaries in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, metropolitan areas through a demonstration project that provides a Tricare Prime option that doesn\u2019t require referrals to in-network specialists. Find more details below. The new coverage or changes in coverage made during open season for Tricare and other federal programs take effect Jan. 1, 2026. Beneficiaries can check if their information is up to date in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System online at tricare.mil.deers . Those who are satisfied with their health care plan don\u2019t need to take action. Tricare open season applies to those currently enrolled in or eligible for Tricare Prime, Tricare Prime Remote, U.S. Family Health Plan, Tricare Prime Demonstration Project, Tricare Prime Overseas, Tricare Prime Remote Overseas, Tricare Select and Tricare Select Overseas. The open season doesn\u2019t apply to individual active-duty service members or beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare for Life, where coverage is automatic for those who have Medicare Part A and Part B. Those eligible for the premium-based plans \u2014 Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Tricare Young Adult \u2014 can purchase the plans at any time of the year. What troops, military families need to know about Tricare open season Dental, vision and tax-saving accounts Monday, Dec. 8: The Federal Benefits Open Season ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Those eligible in the military community can enroll in dental coverage and vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP. Visit www.benefeds.gov for more information and to enroll. This open season ends a day earlier than the Tricare open season. Monday, Dec. 8: As part of the Federal Benefits Open Season, service members can enroll in tax-savings accounts: a health care flexible spending account and a dependent care flexible spending account. These pre-tax accounts allow troops to set aside up to $3,400 in 2026 to pay for health care costs that Tricare doesn\u2019t cover. Dependent care flexible spending accounts help defray the costs of child care and other dependent care. The Internal Revenue Service allows individuals to set aside up to $7,500 per year for dependent care costs if they are married and file a joint tax return or if they file as single or head of household. Visit fsafeds.gov for more information and to enroll. Previous participation in these flexible spending programs doesn\u2019t automatically carry over, meaning individuals must must enroll each year. New Tricare Prime demo starts in 2026 Roughly 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries living in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, metropolitan areas will have a new Tricare Prime option next year through a demonstration project being conducted by the Defense Health Agency. Those interested must enroll during open season. For more information and to enroll, visit enrolltricare.com , or call 877-996-9333 from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday. Those eligible can also enroll through the web enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil by searching for Tricare Prime demo. Information was not available about how many beneficiaries have signed up to date for the demonstration project. CareSource Military and Veterans Co ., of Dayton, Ohio, will run three-year demonstration projects for the two areas, under contracts worth a combined total of $110 million. Those eligible are active-duty family members; family members of activated National Guard or Reserve members; retirees, their family members or survivors who aren\u2019t eligible for Medicare; and those enrolled in the Transitional Compensation Program. A key benefit for those enrolled in Tricare Prime through this project is that they won\u2019t be required to get referrals for in-network specialty care, as is normally required in Tricare Prime. \u201cWe\u2019ve received positive feedback from beneficiaries enrolling in the Tricare Prime demo \u2026 especially regarding their ability to see in-network specialists without referrals,\u201d CareSource officials said in a statement to Military Times. \u201cMany beneficiaries also indicated that maintaining their providers and comprehensive coverage was an important factor in their decision.\u201d For the first year of the demonstration project, enrollment fees are waived for retirees, their family members and survivors. Active-duty service members, their family members and transitional survivors don\u2019t pay Tricare Prime enrollment fees. While those in Tricare Select currently don\u2019t have to get referrals, they could choose to switch to the Tricare Prime demo option which doesn\u2019t require referrals and also provides the additional benefit of case management and care coordination for those who need it. CareSource will help Tricare families navigate finding a provider, getting an appointment and providing more hands-on personal support.

    "description": "The VA scrapped a $77 million leftover green energy program that would have put solar-powered charging stations for electric vehicle at various locations.",
    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs last month scrapped a $77 million leftover green energy program from the Biden administration that would have put solar-powered charging stations for electric vehicles at VA medical centers and other facilities. In a Nov. 19 release, the VA made clear its opposition to federal funding for green energy programs in general and charging stations in particular, although the Trump administration in August was forced under court order to release up to $5 billion approved by Congress for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program to build a nationwide network of charging stations along major highways. \u201cIn Joe Biden\u2019s VA, the department was distracted by woke social-justice programs and green-energy boondoggles, but those days are long gone,\u201d VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a VA release. \u201cVA exists to serve veterans, and we\u2019re making sure all of our resources go toward that noble purpose.\u201d The VA has yet to decide how all of the $77 million will be redirected, but Collins said that three projects have already been targeted, beginning with $10 million for upgrading VA\u2019s Friendship House residence in Oklahoma City; $21.3 million for the MRI ward at the Providence, Rhode Island VA Medical Center; and $13.8 million to upgrade the radiation oncology unit at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VAMC in Jackson, Mississippi. The move to scrap the charging stations brought the VA more in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s long-held claims that green energy programs are a wasteful concessions to climate change alarmists. He has consistently maintained that clean energy sources, such as solar and wind, cost more and don\u2019t work as well as fossil fuel options. Shortly after taking office last January, Trump issued an executive order \u2014 \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d \u2014 rejecting what he called former President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cpreposterous\u201d emphasis on electric vehicles and calling for the elimination of regulations favoring electric vehicles over gas-powered trucks and cars. Despite Trump\u2019s stance, all branches of the military maintain long-standing clean energy programs, including the Army\u2019s plan to field a fleet of non-tactical, all-electric vehicles by 2035 and efforts to put solar-powered charging stations on bases. In a February 2023 release by the Fort Hood Army base in Texas, Kristina Manning, then-Real Property Planning Division chief at the Fort Hood Directorate of Public Works, noted, \u201cLike many things, Fort Hood is on the cutting edge for the Army on the fielding of EV and charging stations. \u201cProviding charging stations for personal use supports our People First stance and contributes to the quality of life for our soldiers and families by having charging options available for EV owners,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThese charging stations are free because they are solar and do not use any electricity from the grid.\u201d In the ongoing battle over climate change initiatives, Trump used the world stage in September to double down on his views that environmentalists have it all wrong. \u201cThis climate change. It\u2019s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,\u201d Trump said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. \u201cAll of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don\u2019t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\u201d But at a White House Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump insisted that he was not opposed to electric vehicles, but rather \u201cinsane\u201d mandates for the public to buy them. \u201cI like electric cars, I like all cars,\u201d Trump said, adding that the public should have the option to buy gas-powered vehicles. Still, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in August begrudgingly said that federal funding would resume for the NEVI program initiated by the Biden administration. \u201cIf Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let\u2019s cut the waste and do it right,\u201d Duffy said in a release. Duffy claimed that the Biden administration failed to deliver EV chargers as promised, but \u201cOur revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.\u201d \u201cWhile I don\u2019t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress\u2019 will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,\u201d he said.",

    "description": "After the U.S. Mint stopped producing pennies, various stores, including military shops, are running out of the coins.",
    "content": "Citing a nationwide shortage of pennies, some stores have started rounding purchases up \u2014 or down \u2014 to the nearest nickel. Other stores, including military shops, acknowledge that at some point they\u2019re going to run out of pennies and have made plans to address it. For now, military customers may want to empty those piggy banks before heading out to pay cash for holiday shopping. Beginning Jan. 1 \u2014 or sooner if penny supplies run out \u2014 cashiers at Army and Air Force Exchange Service stores will round cash purchases up or down to the nearest nickel or dime, according to AAFES spokeswoman Julie Mitchell. Navy Exchanges will also begin rounding up or down when their registers are out of pennies, according to Navy Exchange Service Command spokeswoman Kristine Sturkie. The moves come on the heels of penny production being stopped after 232 years. The United States Mint struck its final penny on Nov. 12. In February, President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. Mint to stop producing pennies, citing cost savings. Over the past decade, the cost of producing each 1-cent coin has risen from 1.42 cents to 3.69 cents, according to the U.S. Mint. Fewer people are using cash for purchases, and some have advocated for the retirement of the 1-cent coin for years. With that change, banks are no longer able to order the coin, and merchants in multiple regions of the country have run out, according to the Associated Press. The penny is still legal tender, meanwhile, and there are an estimated 300 billion of them in circulation, far exceeding the amount needed for commerce, according to the U.S. Mint. Here\u2019s what to expect: This change will not impact overseas military exchanges, where cashiers have already been rounding up or down for cash purchases for years. AAFES stores overseas have been rounding since 1980. AAFES : If the last digit of the purchase is 3, 4, 6 or 7, the purchase will be rounded to the nearest nickel. If the last digit of the total purchase ends in 1, 2, 8 or 9, the total purchase will be rounded to the nearest dime, according to AAFES\u2019 Mitchell. Navy Exchanges : If the change due ends in 1, 2, 6 or 7, it will be rounded down to the nearest 5 cents. If the change ends in 3, 4, 8 or 9, it will be rounded up. These rounding policies only apply to cash transactions and don\u2019t affect credit, debit or gift card purchases. Those customers still pay the exact price.",

    "description": "Democratic leaders want answers on a path towards compromise on a host of federal budget fights before the end of next month.",
    "content": "Democratic congressional leaders on Thursday warned that federal agencies are headed towards a partial government shutdown at the end of September unless the White House and Republican leadership provide clear answers on a budgetary solution soon. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Thursday, the chambers\u2019 top Democrats \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York \u2014 asked for a meeting on the looming fiscal issues early next week, to stave off a budget crisis. \u201cThe government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way,\u201d the pair wrote. \u201cThat is the only viable path forward \u2026 \u201cIt is past time you reveal your plans to meet the needs of the American people. Otherwise, it is clear that you have abandoned bipartisanship altogether and are preparing to shut down the government.\u201d Lawmakers have until Sept. 30 to pass a new budget for the next fiscal year (which starts Oct. 1) or approve a short-term extension of current agency funding levels. Failure to do either will force a partial shutdown of most government activities until a new funding deal is reached. Looming government shutdown could hurt military families, veterans For the Department of Defense, that will mean shuttering of some non-essential base offices and training. Troops will still be expected to report for duty, but their paychecks may be delayed. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, most hospital and benefits processing offices will remain open, thanks to advance funding approved for the agency in the past. But some information hotlines will be shut down, and other non-critical services will halt during the political impasse. Neither Republican leader offered an immediate response to the Democratic leaders\u2019 request. Both men have said that resolving the funding issue will be their top priority when Congress returns from its summer recess next week. Although GOP lawmakers hold a majority in both chambers, several prominent Republicans have suggested they may not support a short-term budget deal, preferring to return to regular order in the appropriations process. But the majority of funding bills still have significant work to be completed before final passage. That would mean at least some Democratic votes will likely be needed to approve any funding package and avoid a shutdown. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump said he would meet with Schumer and Jeffries to discuss potential points of compromise, but added that \u201cit\u2019s almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\u201d Defense Department leaders have warned about the potential detrimental impact of a government shutdown on military operations, even if troops and essential personnel remain on the job. They said that shuttering support services for military families and disrupting long-term procurement plans undermines force readiness initiatives. The last major government shutdown occurred in December 2018 during the first Trump administration and lasted for 35 days. That dispute, which centered on immigration policy and funding, did not include the Departments of Defense or Veterans Affairs, but did result in delayed paychecks for tens of thousands of U.S. Coast Guard personnel. Lawmakers are expected to return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Sept. 2.",

    "description": "Patient satisfaction rates have improved steadily at VA in recent years, but Trump insists his changes have reformed the entire department.",
    "content": "President Donald Trump this week claimed that trust scores for patients in the Veterans Affairs health care system have risen dramatically since he returned to office in January, but department data doesn\u2019t back up his claim. During an Oval Office event with military families on Monday, Trump praised the work of VA Secretary Doug Collins thus far, asserting that the department now has a \u201c93% approval rating\u201d under his leadership. \u201cWe had a great first term and it was pretty close to that then,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then [President Joe Biden\u2019s administration] took over and it went down into the 30s and 20s. It went down at one point to 28% or 29%, which is terrible \u2026 But now you\u2019ve blown everyone away, Doug.\u201d Trump\u2019s boast appears to reference VA\u2019s periodic survey of veterans who have used department health care services in the last 90 days. As of the start of August , the satisfaction rate with VA medical care sat at 92.8%, the highest mark in the 30 months that the survey has been conducted. Trump, Hegseth float renaming Defense Department to Department of War When that polling began in March 2023 \u2014 during the Biden administration \u2014 the figure was 90.4%. It has steadily improved nearly every month for the past two and a half years, regardless of which administration was in charge. The broader VA Trust survey , conducted quarterly since early 2016, shows a similar story. At the start of Trump\u2019s first term in the White House, only about 55% of veterans said they trusted the department to \u201cfulfill our country\u2019s commitment to veterans.\u201d By the time Trump left office at the end of 2020, the number was up to nearly 79%. VA data shows the trust score remained between 78% and 81% during Biden\u2019s entire term in office, far above the under 30% that Trump claimed on Monday. The latest department update shows that 79.2% of veterans expressed confidence in the department at the start of the summer, down about 1% from a year earlier. Department researchers also began an annual outpatient survey in fiscal 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term in office, to gauge satisfaction rates. That year, 85% of patients said they were happy with how agency staff handled their outpatient care appointments and procedures. At the end of Trump\u2019s first term in office, it had risen to 89.1%. At the end of last fiscal year \u2014 the latest data available \u2014 the number was up to 92%. Trump claimed the improvement in veterans perception of VA came because the previous administration \u201cgave away choice and accountability \u2026 and we put them back.\u201d That claim has been at the root of continued political sparring between administration officials and Democratic critics of Trump\u2019s veterans policies. Republicans in recent weeks have pushed through a series of reforms designed to make it easier for veterans to access health care options outside the VA system, but the impact of those moves still remains to be seen. During Monday\u2019s event, Collins noted that department officials have reduced the disability claims backlog by about 40% since January. That number has also been in steady decline for the last two years, since the backlog spiked to more than 400,000 cases after the passage of the PACT Act.",

    "content": "Veterans Affairs leaders will not conduct their annual employee surveys this year, stating that they are confident that the majority of the workforce is happy with the direction of the department. Late last week, the Office of Personnel Management announced in an email to federal workers that they had canceled plans for the 2025 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, typically conducted each spring. Officials had said for months they were revising the poll to better focus questions on key workplace issues and not extraneous topics, such as diversity programs. The survey is mandated under federal code and provides an annual snapshot of employee satisfaction . Administration officials have not said whether they will provide other avenues for tracking those metrics. Earlier this summer, in response to questions about workforce changes, Veterans Affairs officials said they would conduct their own all-employee survey in conjunction with the FEVS. VA severs ties with most federal unions, terminating worker contracts However, after last week\u2019s decision, VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said that his department \u201cis following OPM\u2019s lead on this issue and will not be conducting the VA All-Employee Survey this year.\u201d He also dismissed concerns that the absence of the polling data would ignore concerns within the department\u2019s workforce. \u201cVA employees are happy the department is fixing many of the problems left by the Biden administration and is making improvements across the agency,\u201d he said in a statement. The VA All-Employee Survey has been conducted every year since 2006. In 2012, the results ranked the department as the second-worst large federal agency to work for, out of 19 departments. By 2024, that ranking had risen to fifth-best. About 72% of VA employees surveyed said they were satisfied with their jobs in 2024, up from about 55% a decade before. Officials from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration frequently cited the survey as evidence that they were making workforce improvements throughout VA. Whether this year\u2019s survey would have shown continued optimism or new problems will remain unknown. Union officials and critics of President Donald Trump have strongly objected to a host of workforce reforms by his administration in recent months, including trimming nearly 30,000 jobs from the department payroll since January. Earlier this month, VA Secretary Doug Collins announced plans sever ties with most federal employee unions, terminating their collective bargaining contracts. About 450,000 federal employees currently work at VA hospitals, benefits centers and other offices. In the past, nearly three-fourths of the workforce participated in the employee surveys.",

    "description": "Department leaders last month uncovered more than $100 million in duplicate government payments for medical services.",
    "content": "Veterans Affairs leaders are working with Medicare officials to cut down on duplicative billing for veterans medical services, but outside experts say fully fixing the problem will require better record-keeping and patient monitoring by both agencies. Last month, VA administrators launched a partnership with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to recover improper payments to medical providers who billed both agencies for patient services. An initial review found roughly $106 million in duplicate billings over a six-year period. But that may be just the start. About 5.9 million veterans are dually enrolled in VA health care and Medicare, creating confusion in some instances regarding which government agency is responsible for covering the costs of appointments and medical procedures. VA severs ties with most federal unions, terminating worker contracts A new health care analysis released by the RAND Epstein Family Veterans Policy Research Institute on Tuesday found that nearly 84% of the 8.2 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care system have some form of secondary medical coverage, including Medicare, private insurance or Tricare services. \u201cEnrollment in multiple forms of health care coverage indicates potential inefficiencies and raises questions about whether different programs are making duplicative payments for the same care,\u201d researchers noted in the report. They argue that fixing the problem requires better tracking of which medical systems veterans are enrolled in and what services they are eligible for. The report notes that while the Veterans Health Administration is already working with Medicare officials on fixes, \u201cmaking further use of Medicare, TRICARE, private insurer, and Medicaid claims \u2026 in combination with VHA enrollment, utilization, and cost data would enable VHA to better track the sources of care for its enrolled veterans.\u201d RAND officials also recommended better education of patients about their medical options and eligibility, to help inform their choices. VA officials said that new data-matching agreements with Medicare officials should help curb some of the problems in the future. But they also vowed to continue to look for areas of improvement, both with those two systems and other health care systems.",

    "description": "VA hospitals are having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, the watchdog reported.",
    "content": "NORFOLK, Va. \u2014 Government-run medical centers serving the nation\u2019s veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tuesday\u2019s report from the VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General is based on surveys from late March and early April that were taken at 139 Veterans Health Administration facilities. Severe staffing shortages are not necessarily an indication of vacancies but refer to particular occupations that are difficult to fill. The surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs \u2014 out of 484,000 \u2014 through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The VA later reduced the figure to nearly 30,000 jobs to be cut by this fiscal year\u2019s end on Sept. 30. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said Tuesday that the surveys are unreliable because they do not reflect actual vacancies, which VA officials said were in line with historical averages. But Democratic lawmakers warned that veterans won\u2019t get the health care they need as VA positions become harder to fill. The surveys reflected a 50% increase in the reporting of severe staffing shortages for specific jobs, both for clinical occupations that include doctors and psychologists and for non-clinical jobs that include police and custodial workers. Nearly all of the facilities \u2014 94% \u2014 reported a shortage for medical officer occupations that include doctors, while 79% reported shortages for nurses. The report noted that severe shortages for medical officers and nurses have been identified every year in the report since 2014. Nurses rally outside VA hospitals to highlight staff cuts, vacancies Pete Kasperowicz, the VA\u2019s press secretary, stressed in an email that the report is not based on vacancies and is therefore \u201cnot a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.\u201d \u201cThe report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,\u201d Kasperowicz wrote. He said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with \u201cnormal VA historical averages.\u201d But Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration\u2019s profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA. \u201cThis is a deliberate effort to incapacitate and to undermine veterans\u2019 support for and approval of the care they receive in VA hospitals and clinics,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to wait much longer for appointments. There won\u2019t be specialists available. They\u2019ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.\u201d Simon also noted the VA\u2019s announcement last week that it was terminating collective bargaining agreements for most VA bargaining-unit employees, which could further hurt recruitment. VA severs ties with most federal unions, terminating worker contracts The VA said in a news release that the move will \u201cmake it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America\u2019s Veterans.\u201d But U.S. Sen. Mark Warner said in a news release Tuesday that the Trump administration has made it harder for public servants to do their jobs \u201cand ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they\u2019ve earned.\u201d \u201cWe also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting,\u201d said Warner, a Democrat who represents the veteran-dense state of Virginia. \u201cHow do skyrocketing staffing shortages and declining applicant pools make it more \u2018efficient\u2019 for veterans to access the care and services they deserve? The answer is: they don\u2019t.\u201d",

    "description": "About 80% of VA's roughly 450,000 employees are union members, but the department will no longer honor its contracts with the bargaining units.",
    "content": "Veterans Affairs leaders on Wednesday announced plans to terminate nearly all of its collective bargaining contracts with federal unions , upending employment agreements for hundreds of thousands of department workers. The move affects members of the American Federation of Government Employees , the AFL-CIO (AFGE), the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), the National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU) and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). AFGE alone represents about 300,000 employees working for VA. About 80% of the department\u2019s roughly 450,000-person staff are union members. Department officials said the move was made to \u201cmake it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America\u2019s veterans.\u201d In a statement , VA Secretary Doug Collins attacked the unions as inefficient and harmful to veterans\u2019 care. \u201cToo often, unions that represent VA employees fight against the best interests of veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure VA resources and employees are singularly focused on the job we were sent here to do: providing top-notch care and service to those who wore the uniform.\u201d Nurses rally in DC, call for immediate hiring of VA medical staff Members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration have fought with union officials for months. In April, VA stopped withholding union dues from most employee paychecks, citing an executive order excluding some federal agencies from labor-management relations programs. Wednesday\u2019s move does not impact unions representing 4,000 VA police officers, firefighters and security guards. Officials said the executive order does not apply to those positions. Union leaders for months have protested against proposed cuts at VA and other federal agencies, arguing the smaller staffs will hurt delivery of benefits and health care. They\u2019ve also accused Collins of working to \u201cprivatize\u201d VA services by sending more money for medical appointments into civilian hospitals and medical offices, rather than VA clinics. The unions have also filed numerous lawsuits against the president\u2019s proposed changes to the federal bureaucracy. On Monday, a federal appeals court paused a preliminary injunction that had blocked department heads from making changes to collective bargaining agreements, allowing Wednesday\u2019s contract terminations to move ahead. At the time, AFGE National President Everett Kelley called the ruling \u201ca setback for fundamental rights in America\u201d and promised continued opposition to Trump\u2019s proposals. In a statement after Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Kelley criticized Collins for attacking VA workers\u2019 rights. \u201c[The] decision to rip up the negotiated union contract for majority of its workforce is another clear example of retaliation against AFGE members for speaking out against the illegal, anti-worker, and anti-veteran policies of this administration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t apologize for protecting veteran healthcare and will continue to fight for our members and the veterans they care for.\u201d Officials from National Nurses United accused the Trump adminstration of \u201cwaging class warfare against working people of America\u201d and similarly promised continued legal challenges. \u201cThis president has made it clear he has no respect for the Constitution, but we believe strongly that our right to join together to collectively bargain is constitutionally protected,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cIt cannot be swept away through an overreach of an executive order based on spurious claims.\u201d VA officials said that in addition to eliminating unneeded restrictions on hiring and firing policies, breaking union contracts will free up more than 187,000 square feet of office space currently being used by group representatives. At the start of 2025, federal unions represented more than 1.3 million government workers across a host of agencies.",

    "description": "Abortion services had been offered at VA facilities since late 2022, even in some states where the procedures were outlawed. Now that will end.",
    "content": "Veterans Affairs officials on Monday formally moved to end all abortions at department facilities, calling policies that provided the services at federal hospitals them \u201clegally questionable\u201d and unnecessary. The decision \u2014 outlined in a post in the Federal Register \u2014 would undo the September 2022 order by the previous presidential administration allowing VA medical personnel to conduct abortions in cases of rape, incest and pregnancies that endanger the life or health of an individual. That policy marked the first time VA physicians were permitted to perform abortions on federal property, even in states where it had been outlawed. The new interim rule revokes that authority, and will require patients seeking abortions to seek that medical care outside the VA system. In a statement accompanying the proposal, department officials said the move is designed \u201cto ensure that VA provides only needed medical services to our nation\u2019s heroes and their families.\u201d They argued that the decision to provide abortion services was a political one, and not a response to need. VA secretary nominee promises more medical care options and upgrades In June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Since then, 20 states have outlawed or severely restricted abortion services, prompting a national debate over federal departments\u2019 responsibilities and limits in regards to reproductive health services for women veterans. The rule has been in the works since late July, but has not been publicized by department leaders or White House officials. Per federal regulations, the proposal will now undergo public comment and additional review before becoming permanent policy, but is essentially already being enforced within the department. It impacts individuals using both VA health care services and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Abortion rights advocates decried the move as an attack on critical medical options for veterans and their family members. \u201cThis proposed rule is a smack in the face to those who have served our country and their loved ones, stripping pregnant women of their bodily autonomy and restricting their access to abortion,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward. \u201cOnce again, extreme politicians are attempting to interfere in patient-doctor decision-making, intentionally eroding the trust between pregnant people and their medical providers.\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the move deprives veterans of \u201clife-changing\u201d health care options. \u201cAfter veterans put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms, the Trump administration is trying to rob them of their own freedoms and putting their health at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThis administration is sending a clear message to veterans: that their health and dignity aren\u2019t worth defending.\u201d Democratic lawmakers voiced similar concerns. \u201cThe bottom line is, Republicans don\u2019t care if your health is in danger, if you\u2019re a veteran, or if you\u2019ve been raped \u2014 they want abortion outlawed everywhere, in every circumstance, for everyone,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. and a member of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, said in a statement over the weekend. \u201cThis administration has shown nothing but callous disregard for veterans\u2019 lives, their health care, and their livelihoods\u2014especially when those veterans happen to be women.\u201d But Republican lawmakers praised the move, accusing President Joe Biden\u2019s administration of overreach with the changes made three years ago. \u201cTaxpayers do not want their hard-earned money spent on paying for abortions and VA\u2019s sole focus should always be providing service-connected health care and benefits to the veterans they serve,\u201d a group of six House lawmakers led by House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chairman Mike Bost, R-Ill., said in a statement. \u201cHouse Republicans, alongside President Trump, will always stand up for the sanctity of life.\u201d In their Federal Register filing, VA leaders said the change will not prevent physicians from providing life-saving care in cases of ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, since other provisions within the law already mandate those protections. They also pushed back on the presumed demand for abortion services within the veterans community. Department statistics show that roughly 100 veterans and 40 CHAMPVA beneficiaries have received abortions through VA medical centers annually since the policy change in 2022.

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A bill to end a partial government shutdown is nearing final passage in the House after narrowly clearing a critical procedural hurdle Tuesday afternoon. A vote on passage is expected soon, which would wrap up congressional work on 11 of the annual appropriations bills that fund the government for the budget year ending Sept. 30. The last bill to be worked out covers the Department of Homeland Security where Democrats are demanding more restrictions on enforcement operations. President Donald Trump has said he will sign the bill when it reaches his desk. Speaker Mike Johnson needed near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote. He narrowly got it during a 217-215 vote that was held open for nearly an hour as leaders worked to gain support from a handful of GOP lawmakers who were trying to advance other priorities unrelated to the funding measure. \u201cWe have to work through individual members\u2019 concerns. That\u2019s the game here. It\u2019s a consensus building operation. We do it every day,\u201d Johnson said. Trump had weighed in Monday in a social media post, calling on Republicans to stay united and telling holdouts \u201cThere can be NO CHANGES at this time.\u201d \u201cWe will work together in good faith to address the issues that have been raised, but we cannot have another long, pointless, and destructive Shutdown that will hurt our Country so badly \u2014 One that will not benefit Republicans or Democrats. I hope everyone will vote, YES!,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site. The measure would end the partial government shutdown that began Saturday, In addition to funding most of the federal government through Sept. 30, it includes a short-term funding patch for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 13 as lawmakers negotiate potential changes for the agency that enforces the nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , or ICE. Running Trump\u2019s \u2018play call\u2019 The House had previously approved the final package of spending bills, but the Senate broke up that package so that more negotiations could take place for the Homeland Security funding bill. Democrats are demanding changes in response to events in Minneapolis, where two American citizens were shot and killed by federal agents. Johnson said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d it was Trump\u2019s \u201cplay call to do it this way. He had already conceded he wants to turn down the volume, so to speak.\u201d But GOP leaders sounded as if they still had work to do in convincing the rank-and-file to join them as House lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday after a week back in their congressional districts. \u201cWe always work till the midnight hour to get the votes,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \u201cYou never start the process with everybody on board. You work through it, and you could say that about every major bill we\u2019ve passed.\u201d The funding package passed the Senate on Friday. Trump says he\u2019ll sign it immediately if it passes the House. Some Democrats are expected to vote for the final bill but they did not do so for the initial procedural measure setting the terms for the House debate, making it the tougher test for Johnson and the White House. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has made clear that Democrats wouldn\u2019t help Republicans out of their procedural jam, even though Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer helped negotiate the funding bill. Jeffries, of New York, noted that the procedural vote covers a variety of issues that most Democrats oppose, including resolutions to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation . \u201cIf they have some massive mandate,\u201d Jeffries said of Republicans, \u201cthen go pass your rule, which includes toxic bills that we don\u2019t support.\u201d Key differences from the last shutdown The path to the current partial shutdown differs from the fall impasse, which affected more agencies and lasted a record 43 days . Then, the debate was over extending temporary coronavirus pandemic-era subsidies for those who get health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Democrats were unsuccessful in getting those subsidies included as part of a package to end the shutdown. Congress has made important progress since then, passing six of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund federal agencies and programs. That includes important programs such as nutrition assistance and fully operating national parks and historic sites. They are funded through Sept. 30. But the remaining unpassed bills represent roughly three-quarters of federal spending, including the Defense Department. Service members and federal workers could miss paychecks depending upon the length of the current funding lapse. Voting bill becomes last-minute obstacle Some House Republicans have demanded that the funding package include legislation requiring voters to show proof of citizenship before they are eligible to participate in elections. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., had said the legislation, known as the SAVE Act , must be included in the appropriations package. But Luna appeared to drop her objections late Monday, writing on social media that she had spoken with Trump about a \u201cpathway forward\u201d for the voting bill in the Senate that would keep the government open. Luna and Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., met with Trump at the White House. The Brennan Center for Justice, a think tank focused on democracy and voting rights issues, said the voting bill\u2019s passage would mean that Americans would need to produce a passport or birth certificate to register to vote and that at least 21 million voters lack ready access to those papers. \u201cIf House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown,\u201d said Schumer, of New York. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters.\u201d Johnson, of Louisiana, has operated with a thin majority throughout his tenure as speaker. But with Saturday\u2019s special election in Texas, the Republican majority stands at a threadbare 218-214, shrinking the GOP\u2019s ability to withstand defections. ___ Associated Press video journalist Nathan Ellgren and writers Lisa Mascaro and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report.",

A federal judge blocked the Education Department from finalizing the layoffs last summer. The department rescinded those layoffs and brought impacted employees back to work in December.

Agencies have until Feb. 23 to tell OPM how many work hours any of their employees have spent on union negotiations, collective bargaining, grievance and arbitration proceedings. The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized official time as a waste of taxpayer dollars. Federal unions, however, say official time is completely legal and is meant to support agency workers.

In updated shutdown guidance, the Office of Personnel Management removed references to back pay for furloughed federal employees. OPM\u2019s guidance previously stated that furloughed employees will get paid as soon as possible once any funding lapse ends. But the recent update to the guidance revised several sections referencing back pay for furloughed employees, including how it related to retirement, health insurance and unemployment benefits. Federal employees have always been paid after a shutdown ends, and a 2019 law is meant to ensure back pay for both furloughed and excepted workers.

Under the bill, the Treasury Department grants would only fund digital ID infrastructure that aligns with National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines. The use of digital IDs, like mobile driver's licenses, is seen by some as critical to combating online identity fraud, including the use of deepfakes.

DOJ said NITAAC will extend the current CIO-SP3 contract for another year.

    "content": "<p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Kristi Noem faces intensifying public scrutiny over her leadership of the Department of Homeland Security. Criticism of the former South Dakota governor has focused on her handling of the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal immigration agent and her oversight of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The controversies have prompted calls from Democratic lawmakers &mdash; and a small but noteworthy group of Republicans &mdash; for her resignation or impeachment.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The immediate flashpoint has been the January 24 killing of Pretti, which occurred during ongoing protests in Minneapolis. Noem initially described Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, as a &ldquo;domestic terrorist,&rdquo; a narrative repeated by others in the Trump administration. Her account was almost immediately contradicted by numerous videos that showed Pretti was unarmed and restrained when federal agents shot him repeatedly.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">&ldquo;She should be out of a job,&rdquo; Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said after the videos emerged. While President Donald Trump has publicly said Noem&rsquo;s position is secure, a number of potential successors <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2026/01/29/trump_allies_push_potential_noem_successors_153774.html\">have reportedly emerged</a>, including Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin and Lee Zeldin, who leads the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Noem&rsquo;s handling of the killing &mdash; which came two weeks after a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis fatally shot protestor Renee Good &mdash; follows sustained criticism of her management of FEMA. Lawmakers, disaster response experts, and disaster survivors say her policies have slowed emergency response and delayed recovery funding. Long before the crisis in Minnesota, concerns were building over her approach to FEMA preparedness and spending and its response to calamities like last year&rsquo;s devastating <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/texas-floods-rural-unincorporated-communities-disaster-aid/\">floods in the Texas Hill Country</a>.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a policy of chaotic austerity,&rdquo; said Sarah Labowitz, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies disasters and adaptation.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic-wand policymaking, where you need a crisis in order for something to happen.&rdquo;</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">FEMA helps coordinate the response to major disasters like <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate/why-los-angeles-burning-wildfire-eaton-climate/\">last year&rsquo;s Los Angeles wildfires</a>, but the agency more often acts like a bank, reimbursing states and cities for their disaster preparedness and recovery spending. When Noem took office, she throttled that spending by, among other things, requiring her personal sign-off on all expenses over $100,000. The pace of disbursements has since slowed to a trickle.</p> <div class=\"wp-block-in-article-recirc\"> <article class=\"in-article-recirc\"> <div class=\"in-article-recirc__content\"> <div class=\"in-article-recirc__body\"> <div class=\"in-article-recirc__meta\"></div> </div> </div> </article> </div> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Those restrictions <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/politics/fema-texas-flood-noem\">reportedly hindered the agency&rsquo;s response</a> to emergencies like July&rsquo;s floods in Texas because officials could not pre-position search and rescue teams. The acting head of FEMA at the time, David Richardson, was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/09/24/fema-administrator-david-richardson-texas-floods/\">unreachable for several hours</a>, and the agency did not answer two-thirds of calls to its hotline. More than 130 people died in the floods.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">On Thursday, a coalition of disaster survivors released a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ylon7WawseYf8Bjejr4DJKRPRzFohUox/view\">&ldquo;report card&rdquo;</a> that gave Noem&rsquo;s leadership an &ldquo;F.&rdquo; Brandy Gerstner, a member of that coalition, lost her home and belongings in the Texas flood. She and her family live in the <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/texas-floods-rural-unincorporated-communities-disaster-aid/\">rural community of Sandy Creek</a> and spent three days without power or water waiting for federal assistance.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">&ldquo;Official help was scarce,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Despite that, Kristi Noem and Texas Governor [Greg] Abbott have described the response as exceptional, a lie that insults the memory of those lost in the floods.&rdquo;</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Beyond floods in Texas and fires in Southern California, the United States experienced relatively <a href=\"https://grist.org/extreme-weather/in-2025-america-suffered-a-billion-dollar-disaster-every-10-days/\">few major disasters last year</a>. Even so, Noem&rsquo;s restrictions on FEMA spending has also slowed payments to local governments still recovering from past catastrophes. The reimbursement backlog has reached $17 billion, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/climate/fema-aid-kristi-noem.html\">according to The New York Times</a> &mdash; more than the agency spends on such things in a typical&nbsp; year.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Delays have also affected FEMA&rsquo;s efforts to reduce the impact of future catastrophes. A Grist analysis found that the agency&rsquo;s net spending on resilience grants declined over the past three quarters, even as climate-driven disasters intensified nationwide. The nonprofit news outlet NOTUS <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notus.org%2Ftrump-white-house%2Fkristi-noem-hazard-mitigation-funds-hold-fema&amp;urlhash=ROJ9&amp;mt=xIxXlQyxBssLHmzWrh5k_mS4QS38bzgDdDawR8GHXjJGH24c_DO0HpCCp5hZuYBANt8bhM8t_ys1EQ1itmssutD4EEjLB20mrjXJ2l-4EIAVpQqC5P9iEWxNJQ&amp;isSdui=true&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3B0MLIqH2PQOS%2FJEUDNRjXug%3D%3D\">identified a $1.3 billion backlog</a> of such allocations, the primary source of federal funding for states and cities seeking to harden infrastructure. FEMA terminated another climate resilience program last year, though a court has ordered it to reinstate that program.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Former FEMA chief of staff Michael Coen Jr. said Noem&rsquo;s departure could ease the logjam.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see another secretary coming in that is going to want to review every single grant,&rdquo; said Coen, who served in the Obama and Biden administrations. &ldquo;I would think that most executive leaders &hellip; are gonna find that that is micromanagement.&rdquo;</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Beyond Noem&rsquo;s leadership lie other questions about the agency&rsquo;s direction. The Trump administration has yet to nominate a permanent administrator, leaving Karen Evans, a former cybersecurity official, in charge since Richardson departed in November. Agency leaders have suggested firing more than 11,000 employees, many of them contract workers involved in local response and recovery efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The Trump administration&rsquo;s touted &ldquo;review council&rdquo; was set to produce a report on FEMA&rsquo;s future, but Noem <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/19/noem-odds-with-trump-appointed-panel-over-future-fema/\">reportedly</a> pared the council&rsquo;s final report to a fraction of its original length. The panel abruptly cancelled its plans to present the findings in December, and its deadline has been <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/continuance-of-the-federal-emergency-management-agency-review-council/\">pushed to March</a>.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">&ldquo;I think whether she stays or goes, there are huge issues that have been created in the last year at FEMA that have to be resolved quickly ahead of hurricane season,&rdquo; Labowitz, said, referring to the season to come.</p> <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Noem appeared to soften her approach last week. The agency <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fema-halts-terminations-as-massive-storm-about-to-hit-us\">paused its planned terminations</a>, and Noem hosted <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/30/politics/kristi-noem-fema-winter-storm\">her first in-person briefing</a> with agency employees, whom she attempted to rally ahead of <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate/yes-climate-change-can-supercharge-a-winter-storm-heres-how/\">Winter Storm Fern</a>. She also appeared to respond to mounting criticism on Thursday when she announced the release of $2.2 billion in disaster response funds. The money will reimburse states and local governments for repair costs associated with events like Hurricane Helene, the <a href=\"https://grist.org/accountability/how-vermont-lost-track-of-millions-in-fema-flood-recovery-funds/\">2023 floods in Vermont</a>, and coastal erosion in Louisiana.

    "content": "Interview transcript: Terry Gerton People have argued that America\u2019s innovation edge really depends on small businesses. And there\u2019s a lot going on in that space. At a high level, what are the risks you\u2019re seeing right now? Jere Glover The risk, one, is the Small Business and Innovation Research program, which is a phenomenally great program that\u2019s just over 40 years and has done phenomenal things across the board. If you\u2019ve got a minute, I\u2019ll mention just one new one that we\u2019ve come up with. The National Academy of Sciences did a study in 2022 and found that 12% of all new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration had SBIR funding. And that\u2019s pretty impressive. But what we\u2019ve done recently is look to see what those drugs were and what their annual sales were. What we found was that those drug companies did $24 billion in annual sales of those drugs. So that\u2019s a phenomenal record of success. Of course, everybody knows about all the successes in the other areas. But in terms of new drug approvals, and in terms of new medical devices \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s $36 billion for new drugs, $24 billion for new devices \u2014 that\u2019s $60 billion. That\u2019s a phenomenal result. Interestingly enough, the university-backed part of this program, which is the STTR program, does $5.7 billion. And people have not fully appreciated how important the STTR program is, because it pulls universities and innovators and entrepreneurs together to commercialize those products. And it\u2019s been, together with the Bayh-Dole bill, a phenomenal training experience where we pull people, scientists, engineers from universities together with entrepreneurs who know how to make that product go to the marketplace. It\u2019s a great program and it\u2019s both Bayh-Dole that\u2019s threatened and certainly SBIR being shut down is threatened. Terry Gerton Are you most concerned about the U.S. innovation lead in pharmaceuticals, or are there other spaces and sectors where you think that our innovation lead through small businesses is at risk? Jere Glover A recent study looking at all of the categories of innovation found that of 64 or so that they had identified, China was ahead in 57. We have lost the innovative edge in competition worldwide. And things like the SBIR program hasn\u2019t been increased in size in 15 years, and Bayh-Dole \u2014 folks are threatening the foundation of the Bayh-Dole bill. We don\u2019t have a national strategy to really help small business. We\u2019re using 40-year-old ideas to help small business. We need to be doing a lot more, and we certainly need to be having the SBIR, STTR programs reauthorized and back in place. Terry Gerton Joe, let me come to you because Jerry\u2019s mentioned the Bayh-Dole Act, and that was passed in the 1980s, but the world looks very different now than it did then. What about the current innovation debate do you think most people misunderstand when it comes to businesses that need this kind of protection? Joe Allen Well, actually, Jere and I worked together on the Bayh-Dole Act 45 years ago, and as he just said, actually the world is starting to look more similar as it did in the late \u201970s. I think we need to go back and re-learn some of the hard-won lessons we learned before. If you go back to the 1970s, we were losing technology edge to Japan. A lot people at that time really thought the future of the United States was industrial policy, which is big government and big business, which is what the Japanese did, plotting the future. And luckily we didn\u2019t do that. I used to work for a senator named Birch Bayh, who was a Democrat from Indiana. And one day we were shocked to find out that if a university or a small company worked for the federal government, did R&D, if they made an invention, the government took it away from them and gave it away. So the upshot was billions of dollars being funded. University research was basically being squandered. And the other thing was innovative small companies stayed away from government research, because you couldn\u2019t afford to work with them because they might take your invention away. And Bob Dole was a conservative Republican; Birch Bayh was a liberal Democrat. We were in an election year. And they didn\u2019t agree on much, but they agreed we couldn\u2019t have afford to just give away billions of dollars of government-funded research without getting any economic return. So the Bayh-Dole Act was really an amazing change in Washington, in an election year, by people who were opposed to each other on different things. And basically what it said was, if a university or a small company makes an invention with government research, they can own it. The government can use it for free, but now they can start commercializing it. And that\u2019s the basis of SBIR. Without that basis, you still wouldn\u2019t take government research if they\u2019re going to take the technology away. It\u2019s phenomenal what happened because 70% of university inventions and 70% of federal laboratory inventions are licensed by small companies. Now, in 1980, most people would never have predicted that. They would have figured it was big business like the Japanese model. But it\u2019s small-business entrepreneurs that drive American innovation across the board. Google came out of Bayh-Dole. Google was invented by two kids at Stanford. They came up with a search engine from National Science Foundation funding. No one wanted it. Stanford could not find a single licensee. So these two kids went in and said, let\u2019s start a company. That\u2019s how American innovation drives, and we\u2019re the only country in the world where our innovation is driven by small companies, not big conglomerates, or not by government. And I think that\u2019s one thing that gives an edge over China. But as Jere was just saying, if we don\u2019t pay attention to our knitting, if we weaken SBIR, if we weaken Bayh-Dole, we\u2019re going to go right back to where we were in the \u201970s. And that was not a good place. Terry Gerton So let\u2019s follow up on that because the 8(a) program that\u2019s designed to bring more small businesses into government contracts has really been under intense strain over the last year. Is that kind of eligibility uncertainty hitting small research-oriented firms especially hard? How do you see those disruptions? Jere Glover Well, the 8(a) program has helped set role models and examples for underprivileged minorities and underserved populations. And it worked very well to do that. Over the years, it has helped literally thousands of companies, and it\u2019s also helped be a role model for other companies. So the 8(a) program did work, has worked in the past, and perhaps as with any program tuning and tweaking it might be important. But we still need to make sure that we have everybody in the country know they have a chance to be an innovative and successful small business. Terry Gerton I\u2019m speaking with Jere Glover, who serves as the executive director of the Small Business Technology Council, and Joe Allen, who\u2019s the executive director of the Bayh-Dole Coalition. Joe, let me come to you. The federal government\u2019s relying more and more on small businesses in AI and biotech and defense. What should Congress be paying closest attention to as it considers extending or reauthorizing SBIR and maybe updating Bayh-Dole? Joe Allen Well hopefully they don\u2019t update Bayh-Dole, because I think Bayh-Dole is working as it. The last thing we want is people monkeying around with something that works. There\u2019s so many things in Washington that need to be fixed; this is not one of them. I think the critical thing is, again, it\u2019s been 45 years since we passed Bayh-Dole and probably almost that long since we passed SBIR. Jere and I remember that \u2014most people today don\u2019t. That\u2019s ancient history. And the thing that makes Bayh-Dole unique is Bayh-Dole did not create any bureaucracy, didn\u2019t create any new government funding. So there are not a bunch of cheerleaders in Washington agencies for Bayh-Dole. I think one of the things I\u2019m concerned about is, before Bayh-Dole, you had Washington micromanaging technology management. The agencies would take the technology away and give it away. And Bayh-Dole went in a different direction and said, we\u2019re going to decentralize the power out of Washington and put it in the hands of entrepreneurs. There\u2019s always a tendency in bureaucracies of re-centralization again. You know, we know more, this is a different era, we need to bring this back again, more centralized planning. Which is, again, what China does. I mean, it\u2019s like the Japanese model, except for China\u2019s Japan on steroids \u2014 in the 1980s, Japan was not a military threat, so it\u2019s different. But I think one thing that we need to emphasize is, Bayh-Dole and SBIR are not theories. They work in the hard, cold light of day. They are drivers of our economy. Another stat that people don\u2019t realize, and not just to talk about drugs, but the drug industry as most people think about it is major multinationals \u2014 but 50% of our new drugs originate in small companies. If you look at the companies that actually first licensed mRNA and immunotherapy, which won Nobel prizes, they were small companies. It took 10 years to find an American company because they were so early stage, most big companies didn\u2019t do them. So I think the thing that I\u2019m trying to emphasize in the Bayh-Dole Coalition is: Learn the lessons we learned before. We ran the experiment. We tried giving away technology for 40 years. It didn\u2019t work. And we tried Washington\u2019s micromanagement. There\u2019s a role for Washington, and that\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s appropriate, but it\u2019s not micromanaging the economy, it\u2019s not micromanaging entrepreneurs. And small-business entrepreneurs are doing this on their own dime, on their own risk, and most times they fail. We are the only country in the world that\u2019s been driven by that model, and it\u2019s what makes us unique from China and other parts of the world. Terry Gerton Jere, let me come back to you because Joe said we don\u2019t want to mess with Bayh-Dole, but Congress does have a role here in reauthorizing SBIR and that seems to be really difficult. What do you think the main sticking points are on getting a reauthorization of SBIR? Jere Glover Well, Sen. Ernst said on the floor of the Senate that she would block renewal of the SBIR program unless she got two provisions. One is eliminating the largest, most successful companies from the program, and two, much stronger risk protections for small business. I think that those two provisions are standing in the way. And Sen. Ernst specifically saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care if the program doesn\u2019t succeed\u201d \u2014 and she said it on the Senate floor, so she obviously means it \u2014 the question is, will everybody else realize how important this program is? Since the program lapsed there have been $1 billion dollars and over 1,000 awards not made that would have been made if the SBIR program was in place, going to innovative, creative small businesses, like the drug companies I mentioned that now do $60 billion dollars. In terms of the top drug and annual sales, SBIR was number five, number 13, and number 18 of the top 20. This program really does work, and to have it shut down over policy disputes when it\u2019s been successful for 43 years is a shame. It really is tragic. Terry Gerton Joe, you\u2019ve got an event tomorrow on Capitol Hill to talk about this. What do you hope folks take away? Joe Allen Well, Jere and I are working together. The Bayh-Dole Coalition is a hosting event on Capitol Hill starting at 11:30. Our host is the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Mr. Williams. So what we\u2019re focusing on is what Bayh-Dole has really done in the role of small companies and innovation. Because again, we have a track record, but most people have never heard it. And that\u2019s our real fear \u2014 if we don\u2019t educate people, policymakers, the media, the public, you can\u2019t have people going back, coming up with new theories off the wall that really undo things that are working right now that really make us competitive. So the deputy administrator of SBA is coming. We have an all-star panel, including people like Jere Glover. And again, the Bayh-Dole Coalition, we never have theoreticians. We always have people who have actually done this in the real world. Washington is full of people with theories. That\u2019s great. Nothing wrong with that. But these are things where innovation is something that really is hard to do; it takes a lot of risk; that risk is assumed by small companies, not the government; and we want people to understand that, because this is critically important to our future. As Jere said in the beginning, China is deadly serious about this. China is also replicating Bayh-Dole in their own universities. They\u2019re putting billions of dollars into trying to surpass us in early stage research. They think they\u2019ve already passed us in manufacturing. If we squander that lead, I don\u2019t know how we get it back. I mean, if you lose innovation in manufacturing, I don\u2019t know what you have left that you think is going to make us competitive. We went there in the \u201970s. We revived ourselves when people thought we\u2019d irrevocably lost our lead in technology. We are the undisputed leader of that. And the final thing I\u2019ll say is Bayh-Dole and SBIR have helped launch the most incredible renaissance in technology in human history. In human history. So if you look at where we were in 1980, and if you look at where we are right now, it\u2019s day and night. But again, if you forget the lessons of the past, you\u2019ll have to pay them again, and a lot of times the piper the second time is a lot steeper than the first time.",

    "description": "OPM\u2019s latest guidance states that \u201cCongress will determine via legislation whether furloughed employees receive pay for furlough periods.\u201d",
    "content": "The House passed a spending package to end a short-term partial government shutdown and fund most federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year. The spending deal, which includes a two-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, was passed by the Senate last Friday. The package now heads to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. The stopgap spending for DHS gives lawmakers more time to negotiate over guardrails on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement operations, following the deaths of two protestors in recent weeks. Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday that he will sign the spending package into law \u201cimmediately.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have another long, pointless, and destructive shutdown that will hurt our country so badly \u2014 one that will not benefit Republicans or Democrats,\u201d Trump wrote. The spending package includes language guaranteeing back pay to federal employees who were briefly furloughed during the partial shutdown. The Office of Personnel Management recently updated its shutdown guidance to remove references to the guarantee of back pay for furloughed federal employees once the funding lapse ends. OPM\u2019s guidance states that \u201cCongress will determine via legislation whether furloughed employees receive pay for furlough periods.\u201d Federal employees at agencies impacted by the partial shutdown have been notified of their furlough status. Most workers impacted by the shutdown were given up to four hours to carry out standard shutdown activities on Monday. Congress has now passed comprehensive spending bills that cover a majority of the federal government. The House advanced the spending deal by a slim margin. All House Democrats rejected a procedural vote to bring the spending package to a final floor vote, and House Republican leadership pressed several of their members to advance the bill. The final House vote was 217-214. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s votes, House Republicans warned that another extended government shutdown would have no impact on federal immigration operations. About 80% of the FY 2026 spending bill for DHS covers other non-immigration priorities, including funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Agency. In a press conference ahead of votes, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said that Congress has funded Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations \u201cfor a few years now\u201d through the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that passed last summer. The budget reconciliation bill gave DHS $165 billion to spend over the next decade . Much of the funding goes toward border security and immigration enforcement. The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act set aside billions of dollars for ICE and Customs and Border Protection to hire thousands of frontline personnel and offer bonuses to recruits. \u201cWhat they\u2019ll be shutting down is FEMA operations, as we\u2019re cleaning up from the winter storms. They\u2019ll be shutting down TSA, which is obviously necessary to keep the country moving through our airports,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo many important functions in the Department of Homeland Security is what will be adversely affected by these partisan games.\u201d House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.) urged his colleagues to get this spending package \u201cacross the finish line.\u201d \u201cThe American people deserve stability, and they expect results. These bills deliver both,\u201d Cole said on the House floor. Democrats are calling for new restrictions on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement surge after Border Patrol agents on Jan. 24 fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse working at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. Pretti\u2019s death took place two weeks after an ICE officer fatally shot another protester, Renee Good. The guardrails Democrats are pursuing include an end to sweeping patrols by immigration officials and a prohibition on ICE personnel entering people\u2019s homes without a judicial warrant. Democrats are also seeking body cameras and a ban on federal immigration officials covering their faces. House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said the two-week stopgap funding bill for DHS allows lawmakers to press for \u201creal accountability for the abuses we have seen.\u201d If the House did not approve the spending deal and extended the partial government shutdown, DeLauro warned that \u201cworkers across broad swaths of the federal government would be furloughed.\u201d \u201cPublic services would be scaled back, paychecks would be missed,\u201d she said. The spending package trims overall discretionary spending levels, but rejects the Trump administration\u2019s calls for major spending cuts at most agencies. In one notable exception, lawmakers agreed to rescind $11.6 billion in multi-year modernization funds for the IRS. The IRS agency initially got $80 billion under the Inflation Reduction Act to rebuild its depleted workforce and modernize some of the oldest legacy IT systems in the federal government. Accounting for the latest funding cuts, the agency\u2019s total amount of modernization funding has shrunk to $26 billion. These funds are available to spend through 2031. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found the IRS spent nearly $14 billion of its Inflation Reduction Act funds, as of March 2025.",

    "content": "Jared Serbu | https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/011526_dla_cannon_web.mp3 Download audio From old office furniture to entire warships, when the military services have a piece of equipment they no longer need, it heads to the Disposition Services experts at the Defense Logistics Agency. Quite often, DLA is able to find a new home for those items. But the agency is trying to significantly increase how often that happens, including by maintaining digital \u201cwant lists\u201d from the military services so they can keep track of demand signals. At 43 locations around the world, when DLA takes possession of the Defense Department\u2019s excess property, one of the first tasks is to make a value judgment about how likely it is that the property can be reused. Historically, those judgments have been driven by highly informed guesswork on the part of 500 of the agency\u2019s experts in property reutilization. From expert guesswork to analytics But DLA is working to take a lot of the guesswork out of the process with more data \u2014 both about what types of property are headed its way from the military services, and about what types of property other units are looking for. Central to the effort is an increase in the use of electronic turn-in documents (ETIDs), which are gradually replacing the paper-based forms the military services submit to DLA along with their excess property. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do with the electronic turn-in document is really going to give information to our receivers that they don\u2019t have now, and actually give them the information pre-receipt \u2014 it\u2019s web based, and it gives us the document before the item arrives,\u201d Mike Cannon, the director of DLA Disposition Services, said in an interview with Federal News Network. With a clearer idea of what types of property are headed their way, DLA staff are able to compare that data against digital \u201cwant lists\u201d from the military services, which helps the agency maintain its list of the most commonly-requested excess property. Historically, that\u2019s been depicted on posters at DLA sites. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do as we looked at trying to increase reutilization is with that poster that said, \u2018Here are the 25 types of things that are most reused\u2019 \u2014 we doubled that to 50. Because what was happening was that\u2019s all we were putting on the shelf, and it was a self-licking ice cream cone. These 25 are always the high reuse, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re putting on the shelf,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cSo we expanded it to 50, and then the electronic turn-in document, when it\u2019s filled out, it looks at that list of 50, and it populates the document and tells my receiver, \u2018This is a top 50 item.\u2019 So now they don\u2019t have to look at a poster. They don\u2019t have to guess. They don\u2019t have to misread that. They know right up front that this item is probably a good candidate to put on the shelf.\u201d And having that information in advance also lets DLA prioritize processing of critical items. Previously, property was handled on a first-in, first-out basis, which could delay the availability of urgently needed assets. With advance notice, DLA can identify and expedite processing for items that are essential to military operations. Queue-skipping for critical assets \u201cSo if I have two or three days\u2019 worth of property that I\u2019m working my way through because I had a wave of turn-ins, one of those items might be critical to a warfighter, but I may not touch it for four days,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cIf I know it\u2019s coming in, I\u2019m looking for that item, and I can pull it to the front of the line.\u201d The transition to more data-informed processes also helps Disposition Services make decisions about what to keep and what to scrap or resell based on its value, Cannon said. Data-guided keep vs. sell decisions \u201cTypically, we use the data that\u2019s in the Federal Logistics Information System catalog. What did it cost us to buy this item? Is it high dollar value? Is it low dollar value? Having the services\u2019 backorder information will help inform us. Is this something that\u2019s needed or something that\u2019s not needed? Is it truly obsolete? If there\u2019s no back orders within the service, it\u2019s probably not good for me to put on the shelf and let it sit there. I might as well sell it on the public market or scrap it, so it gives us velocity on the other end,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to not become slaves to data, but make the data work for us, to give us that great information that we need to offer more free stuff to the military, and if we know what they need, we can.\u201d Since the property DLA already receives is already owned by DoD, it can be reissued to another Defense component or command at no cost to them. Last year, Cannon said, DLA re-routed $2 billion worth of excess property back to military components who still needed it. The goal with the transition to more electronic processes is to double that figure. That will come, in part, through greater DoD-wide visibility into demand signals. \u201cThe military services\u2019 supply systems aren\u2019t interconnected, but the turn-in document is used exactly the same by all the services. And if I know the things they need and I can find them, we\u2019ll change how we handle property,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cRight now, everything is first in, first out. Once we get this rolling, we\u2019re going to set up a high price system, where if one of those items that shows up on that ETID, it skips the queue and goes to the front of the line, and then we immediately process it. And rather than taking our time and putting on the shelf, we take it straight from the receiving over to outbound, and get it moving same day or next day to the unit that needs it. It will allow us to do some internal prioritization. Because if you go to one of my sites right now, if they\u2019ve got three days\u2019 worth of stuff, they\u2019re going to do Monday\u2019s work first, then Tuesday\u2019s, then Wednesday\u2019s, no matter the asset. For the ETID stuff, we\u2019re going to move that to the front of the line, and then everything else will be first in, first out.\u201d",

    "content": "Federal agencies are facing a mobile security inflection point. Emerging data confirms that while the threat landscape has fundamentally changed, our defenses have not. Verizon\u2019s most recent Mobile Security Index report highlights the shift. AI-enabled attacks, such as highly targeted smishing campaigns and convincing deepfakes, are now among the most likely cyberattack vectors to succeed. At the same time, mobile attacks have surged dramatically, with reported incidents up more than 80% year over year. Despite this escalation, the dominant response across government and industry remains largely unchanged: more tools, more agents, more policies, all anchored to the assumption that the endpoint itself can be trusted. But that assumption no longer holds true. When adversaries gain speed and scale, endpoint dependence becomes a liability. AI has given attackers both. If your zero trust architecture still requires trusting the device, you do not have zero trust. Mobile has become the weakest link Mobile devices are now essential to day-to-day operations in the Defense Department, civilian agencies and the defense industrial base. They are how people communicate, collaborate and access sensitive systems. Yet they were never designed as enterprise-first platforms. Unlike traditional desktops and laptops, mobile phones are consumer devices by default. They are filled with personal applications, third-party code and constant background services that collect, transmit and correlate data. Most users do not run any form of dedicated mobile security. Even when agencies deploy mobile device management or mobile application management, they are still attempting to control an environment they do not own and cannot fully observe. Attackers understand this. AI-driven social engineering has dramatically reduced the skill barrier required to compromise a user. Smishing messages are now context-aware, personalized, and timed to exploit human behavior. Voice cloning and deepfake video remove long-standing trust cues that users relied on to detect fraud. These attacks do not need to defeat encryption or exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. They only need one tap. Once a mobile device is compromised, the implications extend far beyond that individual user. Credentials, session tokens and authentication workflows are exposed. Lateral movement begins not through the network, but through identity. This is why mobile has become the most reliable initial access point for adversaries targeting government and critical infrastructure. Beyond phishing and malware, mobile devices introduce attack vectors that do not exist in traditional computing environments. Bluetooth and near-field communication (NFC) radios are always on, always listening and often poorly monitored. Bluetooth-based exploits are no longer theoretical. Tools readily available today allow attackers to scan crowded environments for exposed devices, identify vulnerable configurations, and exploit them at close range. NFC, designed for convenience, can be abused in similar ways. In operational environments (conferences, transportation hubs and forward-deployed settings) proximity-based attacks are a real and growing risk. These are not remote, abstract threats. They target personnel where they work and travel, often without any visible indication that a compromise has occurred. When agencies focus exclusively on network-based defenses or endpoint compliance checklists, they miss this entire class of exposure. The problem with device-centric zero trust In response to these realities, many organizations double down on endpoint controls. They deploy additional agents, enforce stricter policies, and attempt deeper inspection of devices they do not own. This approach creates three critical problems. First, it does not scale against AI-enabled threat velocity. Attackers can now generate new lures, payloads and delivery mechanisms in minutes. Defenders cannot patch, update and reconfigure endpoints fast enough to keep pace. Second, it increases operational friction. The more intrusive security becomes, the more users find workarounds. Shadow IT, unmanaged devices and risky behaviors increase. Not because users are careless, but because missions still need to get done. Finally, it creates a false sense of security. A \u201cmanaged\u201d device is not a trustworthy device. Firmware-level compromise, supply chain manipulation and user-installed applications all operate below or outside the visibility of most enterprise tools. Trusting the endpoint is still trusting something the adversary is actively targeting. A data-first, device-agnostic alternative Government agencies shouldn\u2019t be thinking about how to better secure the device; they should be working to remove devices from the security equation all together. A data-first, device-agnostic mobility model flips the paradigm. Instead of assuming the endpoint can be secured, it assumes the opposite: that the device may already be compromised. Sensitive data, applications and processing remain in controlled environments, while the device becomes nothing more than a window. In this model, there is no data at rest on the device and no sensitive data traversing exposed networks. Identity, access control, monitoring and policy enforcement occur where organizations already have visibility and authority. If a device is lost, stolen or compromised, the risk is contained by design, not by cleanup. This approach aligns far more closely with the original intent of zero trust. Trust is placed in verified identities, controlled environments and continuous validation, not in hardware that operates outside the organization\u2019s control. Adapting mobile security in the world of AI cyberattacks AI has permanently altered the economics of cyberattacks. It favors speed, scale and manipulation over technical sophistication. Mobile devices are a natural vector for attack in this environment. Federal agencies do not need more tools bolted onto an outdated model. They need architectural clarity. As long as security strategies depend on securing and trusting endpoints, attackers will continue to exploit the weakest link. When we stop trusting devices and start protecting data by default, we move from reacting to AI-driven attacks to rendering entire classes of them irrelevant.

    "description": "GAO\u2019s SSA findings show the hidden trade: Forcing the same schedule on every job drains the very talent that the public relies on for timely benefits decisions.",
    "content": "On January 20, 2025, a signed Return To In-Person Work memo landed on agency desks and scrambled schedules. At the Social Security Administration, managers watched routine telework collapse within weeks, even as phone lines stayed jammed. A fresh watchdog report shows the human cost: The very flexibility that drew talent in now pushes talent out. The report comes from Trump\u2019s own Government Accountability Office, and it focuses on how the decree rippled through hiring, training and retention. SSA already carries a heavy service load, so every resignation shows up in longer wait times and slower decisions. GAO\u2019s findings, paired with broader federal research, point to a simple lesson: Telework works best when leaders manage it, measure it and use it to keep skills in-house. GAO tracked SSA telework from July 2019 through May 2025 and found a sharp cliff after the White House memo. Telework hours fell from 35% of total hours in January through March 2025 to 13% in April through May 2025, a telework hours drop that matched the new posture. That speed matters because SSA employees had built their lives and budgets around flexibility. Agency leaders told GAO that telework acted as a recruitment lever during a tight labor market. In a fiscal year 2023 new hire survey , more than half of new employees said telework ranked as a very important factor in applying and accepting the job. Managers also described candidates who expected hybrid schedules as a baseline benefit, especially in high-traffic metro areas. Retention signals flashed even before the decree. GAO reports that around 37% of SSA respondents to the 2024 employee viewpoint survey planned to leave within a year. Among those planning an exit, almost half said telework or remote options in their unit shaped that decision. Frontline staff singled out newer hires and retirement-eligible experts as the most ready to move, since both groups value lighter commutes and focused work time. GAO then warned about skills gaps in mission critical roles, right as SSA pursued a 50,000 employee target announced in a February 2025 agency workforce plan aimed at cutting costs. Federal law already treats telework as a management tool and a continuity asset through the Telework Enhancement Act , which requires policies, training and reporting. That framework exists because agencies use telework to keep services running during weather events, security incidents and public health disruptions. OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2023 telework status report describes agencies that used hybrid schedules to lift recruitment and retention while sustaining performance. In the same report, the Treasury Department\u2019s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau credits telework with shrinking its Washington, D.C. footprint by 22% and saving nearly $1 million in facility costs, a concrete real estate savings example that private employers envy. The Environmental Protection Agency also reports about $7 million a year in avoided transit subsidy spending at current telework levels, another budget relief that frees funds for mission work. Those dollars connect directly to retention because agencies reinvest savings in better tools, training and workspace design. When leaders pair clear performance standards with predictable flexibility, they win a recruiting edge and keep accountability high. That formula matters more in government than in most sectors because hiring cycles run long and specialized knowledge takes years to build. Long before the pandemic, the Merit Systems Protection Board laid out a business case: With solid supervision, telework delivers benefits while maintaining productivity, as detailed in its telework evidence . The board also highlights continuity of operations, reduced real estate pressure and better work life balance from shorter commutes. GAO\u2019s own prior work urged agencies to measure telework impacts on customer service, training and organizational health, which appears in the November 2024 performance evaluation report . In the new SSA study, GAO repeats that call and presses the agency to update its human capital plan and keep evaluating telework where offices still use it. Trump\u2019s administration framed the return push around supervision and fairness, echoing language from the January 2025 guidance memo . GAO\u2019s SSA findings show the hidden trade: Forcing the same schedule on every job drains the very talent that the public relies on for timely benefits decisions. A smarter approach uses job-based eligibility, transparent metrics and targeted onsite time for training, mentoring and complex customer work. Agencies that build that system keep their best people longer, save money and deliver service with steadier staffing. Return mandates feel decisive, yet GAO\u2019s audit trail at SSA shows decisive moves can create staffing turbulence. Employees who joined for flexibility now scan the market, and managers lose years of expertise with every departure. Government has tools to do better: law, reporting and research tying telework to continuity and cost control. Leaders can honor in-person collaboration by designing office time around work needs and using data to adjust. When the federal workforce stays whole, the public feels it first.

    "content": "President Donald Trump signed a roughly $1.2 trillion government funding bill Tuesday that ends the partial federal shutdown that began over the weekend and sets the stage for an intense debate in Congress over Homeland Security funding. The president moved quickly to sign the bill after the House approved it with a 217-214 vote. \u201cThis bill is a great victory for the American people,\u201d Trump said. The vote Tuesday wrapped up congressional work on 11 annual appropriations bills that fund government agencies and programs through Sept. 30. Trump has said he will sign the bill when it reaches his desk, ending the partial government shutdown that began Saturday. Passage of the legislation marked the end point for one funding fight, but the start of another. That\u2019s because the package only funds the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks, through Feb. 13, at the behest of Democrats who are demanding more restrictions on immigration enforcement after the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis. Leaders are digging in for a fight Difficult negotiations are ahead, particularly for the agency that enforces the nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly warned Democrats would not support any further temporary funding for Homeland Security without substantial changes to its immigration operations, raising the potential of another shutdown for the department and its agencies. \u201cWe need dramatic change in order to make sure that ICE and other agencies within the department of Homeland Security are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement organization in the country,\u201d Jeffries said. Speaker Mike Johnson said he expects the two sides will be able to reach an agreement by the deadline. \u201cThis is no time to play games with that funding. We hope that they will operate in good faith over the next 10 days as we negotiate this,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe president, again, has reached out.\u201d But Johnson\u2019s counterpart across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., sounded less optimistic of a deal. \u201cThere\u2019s always miracles, right?\u201d Thune told reporters. Voting with no margin for error The funding bill that cleared Congress Tuesday had provisions that appealed to both parties. Republicans avoided a massive, catchall funding bill known as an omnibus as part of this year\u2019s appropriations process. Such bills, often taken up before the holiday season with lawmakers anxious to return home, have contributed to greater federal spending, they say. Democrats were able to fend off some of Trump\u2019s most draconian proposed cuts while adding language that helps ensure funds are spent as stipulated by Congress. Still, Johnson needed near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote on the bill. He narrowly got it during a roll call that was held open for nearly an hour as leaders worked to gain support from a handful of GOP lawmakers who were trying to advance other priorities unrelated to the funding measure. The final vote wasn\u2019t much easier for GOP leaders. In the end, 21 Republicans sided with the vast majority of Democrats in voting against the funding bill, while that exact same number of Democrats sided with the vast majority of Republicans in voting yes. Trump had weighed in Monday in a social media post, calling on Republicans to stay united and telling holdouts, \u201cThere can be NO CHANGES at this time.\u201d Key differences from the last shutdown The current partial shutdown that is coming to a close differed in many ways from the fall impasse, which affected more agencies and lasted a record 43 days . Then, the debate was over extending temporary coronavirus pandemic-era subsidies for those who get health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Democrats were unsuccessful in getting those subsidies included as part of a package to end the shutdown. Congress made important progress since then. Some of the six appropriations bills it passed prior to Tuesday ensured the current shutdown had less sting. For example, important programs such as nutrition assistance and fully operating national parks and historic sites were already funded through Sept. 30. The remaining bills passed Tuesday mean that the vast majority of the federal government has been funded. \u201cYou might say that now that 96% of the government is funded, it\u2019s just 4% what\u2019s out there?\u201d Johnson said. \u201dBut it\u2019s a very important 4%\u201d Associated Press video journalist Nathan Ellgren and writers Lisa Mascaro, Joey Cappelletti and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",
