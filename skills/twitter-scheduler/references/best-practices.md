# Twitter Marketing Best Practices for FedBuyOut

## Twitter Algorithm Optimization

### What Works

**Timing**
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM - 3 PM ET
- Avoid late evenings (after 8 PM) and weekends
- Consistency > volume (3-5 quality posts/week beats daily mediocre)

**Content Types That Perform**
- Threads (2-5x engagement vs single tweets)
- Lists and step-by-step guides
- Statistics and data
- Questions and polls
- Visual content (images, infographics)

**Engagement Signals**
- Replies within first hour boost visibility
- Quote tweets > likes > retweets (in terms of algorithm weight)
- Video content gets 10x engagement

### What to Avoid

- Posting links without context (reduces reach)
- Overusing hashtags (max 3-5 per tweet)
- Automated/robotic language
- Posting at low-engagement times
- Deleting tweets (hurts account trust)

## Engagement Tactics

### Reply Strategy

1. **Monitor notifications** - Reply within 1 hour when possible
2. **Ask follow-up questions** - Keep conversations going
3. **Use their name** - Personalize replies when appropriate

### Community Building

  - Small business owners in target industries
  - GovCon consultants and experts
  - SBA and agency accounts
