### Follow-Up (No Response - 3 Days)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up on your contract sale inquiry

```
Hi [NAME],

I wanted to follow up on my email from a few days ago regarding your 
interest in selling your government contract.

I understand you're likely evaluating your options. I wanted to share a 
quick overview of how we work:

✓ We buy contracts directly (no brokers or middlemen)
✓ Cash offers within 48 hours of review
✓ No obligation or pressure - just a fair offer

If you're still exploring this option, I'd be happy to provide a no-pressure 
valuation of your contract. 

Would a brief call work this week?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

### Follow-Up (No Response - 1 Week)

Hi [NAME],

I wanted to reach out one more time regarding your government contract.

If your plans have changed or this isn't the right time, I completely 
understand. If you're still interested but have questions, I'm here to help.

Either way, just reply and let me know where things stand.

If I don't hear back, I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't continue 
to follow up.

Best wishes,
