# Memory Log - 2026-01-31

## Session Summary
- **User:** Odin (Winston Mpho Maofra)
- **Context:** WhatsApp main session
- **Activities:** Deployed FedBuyOut website, configured PWA, fixed issues

## Key Events

### 1. Website Migration (FedBuyOut)
- Cloned repo from GitHub (MrMafora/Buyout-Pension-Calc)
- Set up PostgreSQL database
- Deployed to DigitalOcean server (IP: 143.110.225.185)
- Configured PM2 process manager
- Fixed Express 5 routing issues
- Website live on port 5000

### 2. PWA Conversion
- Created manifest.json
- Created service worker (sw.js)
- Added icon files in multiple sizes
- Updated index.html with PWA tags
- Generated app icons (scale/calculator design)

### 3. Configuration Changes
- Disabled auto-TTS (changed from "always" to "off")
- Updated IDENTITY.md to reflect text-only default mode
- Fixed email module to not crash without API key

### 4. Pending Tasks
- DNS update needed (point fedbuyout.com to 143.110.225.185)
- SSL certificate installation (waiting for DNS)
- Resend API key for email functionality
- Custom app icons (Odin generating)
- Business operations to begin after go-live

## Decisions Made
- Option A hosting (self-hosted on this server)
- PWA approach for mobile (not native app)
- Keep GitHub repo public (security risk minimal)

## Technical Notes
- Express 5 uses different catch-all route syntax
- PM2 ecosystem config manages environment variables
- Nginx reverse proxy configured for port 5000

## Next Session Priorities
1. Complete DNS/SSL setup
2. Test PWA installation on mobile
3. Begin marketing/lead generation
4. Set up business email
